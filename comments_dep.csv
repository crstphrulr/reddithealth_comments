I have kids at 15 and 11 and cannot imagine the hell you lived in as a kid. I know what depression looks like as an adult. I met with it, in a head on collision when I was 35. For many many many months, there was no me. There are chunks of time I don't even remember. I've been fighting the dark for over 7 years now. I know the fight, I am deeply familiar with the bottom below rock bottom. Have been there more times than I can count. Am still fighting. Countless medications and hours in therapy led to a final diagnosis ""treatment resistant major depression"". \nIt's stolen so much from me ...my life, my identity, my energy, my strength, my cognitive and physical abilities, my joy, my friends, my ability to function, my dreams, my family. Everything I once was was taken away, shattered into a million pieces. My kids don't remember the old me. My husband finally got sick after years of caring for me. \nIt's horrible, it's painful beyond anything words can describe, it's lonely, it's sad, it's ...\nI know what it's like to want to give up. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. I know how hard it is to keep hope alive when you don't have any.

They need walking. It's scary walking anywhere as a woman, even in broad daylight and most woman avoid doing so much with their day through this fear which is so widely accepted as normal behaviour for a woman.\nI now have a boyfriend and he's moved into my house, we both work and I actually earn more than him. However I work from home and although I spend 90% of my day at my desk, the other 10% walking the dogs, I'm still expected to clean the house, do the laundry, wash the dishes from the meal that I cooked the night before, and look presentable.\nWe're currently working on dividing housework and he is a great person, he just got caught up in society's gender norms and expectations. He's not used to living with a partner and his stay at home mum did most things for him before he moved out (I know right).\nSo I'm trying really hard to get out these deep deep misogynistic values that are so ingrained from society, every single day whilst looking after my 2 dogs, working 9-5, 5 days a week, cooking meals most nights and suffering an impending mental breakdown and being told by everyone that everything I do is wrong or unladylike.\nDid you know that shaving is such a big time consumer? Why are women made to feel like they have to spend 10 minutes everyday making sure there's no visible hair on their bodies? F that, I will only shave if I feel the need to and if my partner or society doesn't like it then I don't care, i have enough to deal with.\nAnyway so yeah women's lives can be incredibly hard aswell, I know men's can be too, but don't think you're alone as a gender or you have it worse, because I assure you, you dont.\nThe thing you can do is find ways to make life easier, think about what your wife does on a daily basis.

I just found out ours got upgraded over covid, and it's great place to go because they are always nice to you - and because it's a library the small talk stays small, they let you be to read or study, or whatever. If you have a laptop bring it there and zone out. Most have ""rentable"" offices in them or study areas so there is a door. Free wifi. Bring headphones, even if you just go to watch a tv show at least you are getting out of the house and don't have to hear your parents talking. It's good that you guys are close, but I think it's totally natural to get sick of them. Stuck with anyone for too long you start to notice little annoying things, even if you aren't depressed! \n\nMy latest thing is trying audio books, I pop it in when I drive. I love music - but found my local stations were basically stuck on a loop so I tried my first audiobook (free from library) and it's been awesome. They have all sorts of category even self-help and Oprah ones and the new shit too. \n\nMaybe it's time to explore your area, even if it's walk to park, or go to local pet store to browse, you can time it early or late so you don't see ppl to just get used to it - or go midday and strike up a convo, tell person you just moved to town. You'd be surprised to find out most of us are craving the social contact - because so many of us were also trapped during this never ending pandemic... \n\nGood luck OP.

i6m96ia,ue55h8,"I hear you on fixating on the negative. Not being able to access happy memories with her is totally normal. You are traumatized - those images of her sick are fresh and seared into your brain right now. Especially if it is a fast deterioration, you don't have time to process things, and then even afterwards you don't know how to process things! And other people start to move on and you and your dad can't.\n\nIt took a few years to feel at peace with Mum not being here. You'll notice one day that some part of your grief is gone. For me, it was when I stopped (mostly) dreaming about her being sick.\n\nI wish I could tell you more about what helped. Lots of random things. A few days from her birthday, a monarch butterfly flew onto my leg and just rested there, let me pet it, then flew off. Another time, a family friend told me she used to talk about me a lot in a good way (I kinda thought she was ashamed of me). Getting angry helps (preferably not at people or expensive things...I would beat the shit outta my mattress with a small baseball bat). I still sometimes talk to her when I'm very sad.\n\nMy mum also had pretty fast deterioration (6 months) and also came home for her last 3 weeks (she was in a coma by then). She had brain cancer and it changed her a lot mentally and physically. I would think ""that's not Mum."" A big thing was realizing she was Mum before cancer, before I was born, before she could speak - she was always her. Cancer didn't make her less of anything, she was always more than her physical self.\n\nIt's okay to have setbacks. Try not to set a timer on your grief. I still get bitter. I still feel guilt. Sometimes I just cry. You have to allow yourself that. This is a tough journey to be on, especially without much of a support group. But it's NOT impossible and if a mess like me can do it, you can too <3",1651199818,t1_i6ltxh2,/r/depression/comments/ue55h8/is_this_how_therapy_starts_for_everyone/i6m96ia/
