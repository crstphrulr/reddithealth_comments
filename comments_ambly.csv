i6akwi9,uchlqm, its never too late to fix amblyopia..  doctors that said you it cannot be fixed after age 7 it's just not true it's a misunderstanding concept throughout the years..a 27 year old guy goes to the same doctor where I go to and from 20/400 vision to his amblyopic eye now sees a lot better to the point he can sees the world 3d with visual acuity of 20/30 in his amblyopic eye I think ...In my opinion if you work hard and be patient with the therapy you could even completely restore your vision up to 20/20!...for sure the younger you are probably the faster results you going to have but this is no reason to be discouraged..go and search for a doctor who has vision therapy for amblyopia and take care of it..trust me you are not going to regret it!,1650995177,t1_i6ai9rs,/r/Amblyopia/comments/uchlqm/progress_in_amblyopia_at_17/i6akwi9/

I can see maybe 20/40 with my good eye (20/20 with my glasses on), and that's been good enough.\n\nToday, my good eye recently started experiencing some trouble focusing. This was a new experience, so, my first impulse was to do a search on reddit, and look into VT for adults. I had always assumed that I was just stuck with this, so it's exciting to know that there are things out there. (What would it be like to see true 3D???)\n\nI started Welbutrin 3 weeks ago for depression (and have been along for the ride with all of the 'onboarding' symptoms), so I thought it may be related. Since amblyopia is (i think?) primarily a neuro-cortical disorder, it makes sense to me that a neurological medication could have an effect.\n\nI'm also curious about VR therapy and will likely give [https://www.amblyoplay.com](https://www.amblyoplay.com) a shot. Tetris can keep me occupied for hours, now I have an excuse to spend some time each day :)\n\nu/oceanlessfreediver, you mentioned welbutrin & vyvanse below - I'd love to hear more about how you came across these as applicable treatments and about your experience with them.

hw4wsij,snthbk,"I am not sure I have either.\nI am 37 and have perfect vision in my left eye.\n\nMy right eye was never that good, but I don't have any measurements.\n\nI went to eye doctor few times in my life, they always tested my bad eye using Snellen Chart, but only tested it without correction. It always performed worse but the good eye compensated.\n\nIn the past ten years the bad eye got worse to the point I I can't read large large letters. Last week I went to the eye doctor and for the first time a doctor tried the adjustable correct lens on the bad eye.

I neve heard of amblyopia before and started reading about it and possible treatments. I am definitely going to visit another doctor, but as I started reading I began to question if I really have amblyopia. Two things made me doubt it.\n\nFirst is that I have depth perception. I loved going to 3d cinema as a kid. I even bought a red/blue glass to test if I still have it and I do. I also never had problem playing sports like soccer, volley and tennis. However maybe my depth perception is not that good. I was never good at parking cars sideways or dodging holes in the street.\n\nSecond is that my bad eye wasn't that bad when I was younger. I got my driver's license at 18 years old and have been renewing it every 5 years. Each time I had to take an eyesight test. The first two times (18 and 23 years old) I had zero problems with the tests. The last two (28 and 33 years old) I had issues.\n\nRegarding the question how I experience it, it's not a spot, it's blurry for me, specially details.",1644355260,t3_snthbk,/r/Amblyopia/comments/snthbk/wait_do_i_even_have_amblyopia/hw4wsij/
hw5gui5,snthbk,"When I look with only my right eye, everything is fuzzy, and the left 2/3 or so are dark, almost like I'm looking through my left eyelid. So I feel like the blackness could make sense, except the fact that it's in the center of your vision strikes me as odd.\n\nAs for your overall question, I have a few thoughts. You mention having a slight eye turn (strabismus). That makes amblyopia more likely, since that's one of the most common causes of it. I also wouldn't rule it out on the basis of things not being blurry. I'm no expert, but I think part of the usual blurriness is caused by poor vision in that eye to begin with, not by the amblyopia itself. Usually, when the eyes are misaligned, you get double vision (which leads to amblyopia as the brain tries to create a singular image), but also the bad eye doesn't develop proper vision even on its own because it can't focus properly. Maybe yours has okay vision and only the strabismus caused the amblyopia?\n\nBut I do find the centralized dark spot concerning. Amblyopia can also be caused by things that block part of your vision, like cataracts. **I am not saying you have cataracts**, but I do think seeing a retinal specialist to make sure there isn't something going on with the eye itself  (amblyopia is in the brain, not the eye) is a good idea.\n\nI hope that helps.",1644363007,t3_snthbk,/r/Amblyopia/comments/snthbk/wait_do_i_even_have_amblyopia/hw5gui5/
hw5i4dy,snthbk,"For what it's worth, I have amblyopia and 3D isn't a *total* failure for me. I can't watch red/blue 3D on a TV screen, but I can in a theater. Things have a slight tint to them but the effect still works. Modern 3D, in a theater, works somewhat but I'm pretty sure I'm missing a lot of depth details based on how other people describe it. Even on a (decent-sized) TV I can get some depth with active 3D and occasionally with passive.\n\nI also don't *feel* like I lack depth perception in general, though my total inability to do anything requiring hand-eye coordination suggests otherwise. But to me everything looks like it has plenty of depth. I can't imagine how others could see *more*, but I guess that's how things work when you've never experienced them.\n\nIt getting worse with age is normal, too. Children's eyes have an ability to compensate for pretty much anything with relative ease, but that goes away over time. That's part of why more people get glasses as they get older. In addition, your eye actually changes shape somewhat as you age, which is why most older people are nearsighted.\n\nI'd suggest seeing an ophthalmologist. My guess is you saw an optometrist, which is fine for ordinary vision problems but they're less well-versed in amblyopia. But even some ophthalmologists still believe nothing can be done in adulthood, which we know now isn't entirely true. I'd also suggest reconsidering the glasses issue. They may be right--you mention the disparity between your eyes being the reason, so it could be that you'd require one thick lens and one thin, which is less than ideal. But glasses can do a decent amount to reduce eye strain, plus if nothing else, they help protect your good eye from being hit by anything (get the resistant lenses! my last eye doctor actually wrote that directly on the prescription to be extra sure I had that little bit of protection). Even reading glasses could be enough to take some of the edge off, if it takes some effort to focus.",1644363541,t1_hw4wsij,/r/Amblyopia/comments/snthbk/wait_do_i_even_have_amblyopia/hw5i4dy/

The lenses had prism and magnification in an attempt to correct my vision, but mainly to keep my eyes aligned. It helped but never did much. This is about the time Learned that I did not have 3D vision and that was why I could never see the 3D effects in those 3D books from the Scholastic book fairs as a kid. Sad times. \n  \nGot into my 30's and found an optometrist that had a real passion for unique eye issues and she loved learning about my eye history and vision. So, it turns out that yes, I do NOT have 3D vision, amblyopia is still around and my left eye is slightly weaker than my right, BUT they fight for dominance. Literally, with just blinking of my eyes, my focus can shift from the left side to right side dominant and the other focuses in behind it. I have farsightedness (hyperopia) in my left eye and nearsightedness (myopia) in my right. So a blink and opening one first, depending on my needs works like a charm. Or, if they start to wander, a few blinks center them back out. \nmy self-conscious self blinks A LOT around people or wears sunglasses when appropriate (coping mechanism).   \n  \nAt 32 I was referred to an ophthalmologist and had a 2nd corrective surgery to get my eyes aligned. I would say it helped, but not completely. My right eye doesn't wander, but my left still does, but not nearly as frequently as before. My uncorrected vision was never terrible, I only had double vision pre-strabismus surgery. I do get blurred vision from time to time, but that is due to tiredness most the time.   \nMy current prescription is -0.25 R/+1.25 L. Corrected I can hit 20/15 or 20/10 on a given exam.  \n  \nNow, my son on the hand. He got all the bad genes from my wife and I.  \nHe has Amblyopia with hyperopia and heterochromia. Poor kid can't see the food in front of him, but a toy across the room. He's locked on.  \nHe's had the max 3 corrective surgeries to help with the amblyopia and for the most part, it has helped significantly. He is 5 and has been wearing glasses since 6mo. The hope is with the surgeries and Rx, his eyesight gets better as he matures. So Far he's gone from a +6 to just under +3 in both eyes. So we are getting there.",1644066360,t3_skycf0,/r/Amblyopia/comments/skycf0/getting_confused_about_what_amblyopia_actually_is/hvozdqn/

hvrkks1,skycf0,"Holy cow, are you me? We have a very similar set of eye issues/history and even a similar Rx. I've yet to meet an optometrist or ophthalmologist who is interested in my situation however. In fact the last two ophthalmologists I saw both discouraged me from seeking vision therapy saying it was more likely to give me double vision than it was to give me 3D vision, that it mostly helps people with esotropia, and that I should consider myself lucky that my brain mostly suppresses the alternate eye. For basically that reason, I'm kind of dreading the idea of another surgery, though I get more self conscious as time goes on that my esotropia is noticeable (especially with all these zoom meetings -- oh god)\n\n> they fight for dominance\n\nI'm curious about your wording. Do your eyes switch on their own? In my case, my childhood ophthalmologist called me an ""alternator."" I have complete control over which eye is dominant at a given time and can switch at will, no blinking necessary. As I've gotten older I largely prefer my left eye over my right, unless my vision is blocked in my left eye or some other circumstance, to the point that I'm concerned I may be making things worse. I don't know if it's a subtle acuity thing (reading feels wrong/slower out of my right eye) or just what I'm used to (certainly, my eye muscles feel weird and different when I focus with my right eye; but sometimes I get in a rut of it and it feels weird to switch back to the left. I *have* to use my left eye when driving, or everything looks wrong to me. Weirdly, I tend to be more crosseyed when I view things out of my left eye. If someone's taking a picture of me I look at the camera with my right eye, or defocus both of my eyes.\n\nAnyways, excuse my rambling, I just think it's interesting.

huulv2n,sfwtfa,">Oh wow, thank you for the information! I didn't know that playing games could help with amblyopia, how does that work? \n\nThere are several types of amblyopia so it depends on what kind you have. However the most common type is refractive amblyopia which is\n\n‚ÄúRefractive amblyopia happens when there is a large or unequal amount of refractive error (glasses strength) between a child's eyes. The brain does not learn how to see well from an eye that has a great need for glasses. ‚Äú\n\nWhat that means is due to some refractive difference between eyes, the brain ignores or suppresses the weak eye. The point is it‚Äôs neurological and the fix is to train your brain to stop suppressing the weak eye.  \n\nJust playing any game will not work, you must play games in a way that ‚Äúanti-suppress‚Äù the weak eye. There are games and systems that do exactly that. Sometimes you can even modify regular games and make the anti-suppressing.  \n\nFor example, the main way anti-suppressing games work is by wearing a color filter over the non-amblyopic eye (the good eye) and then playing a game where that color is now hidden from the good eye, this forces the brain to use the amblyopic eye (weak eye) to see all the required picture to play the game.\n\nSo if I play Crossy roads with a red translucent filter over my good eye, and all the cars are a properly calibrated red color, they appear invisible to my good eye. I can test this by simply closing my bad eye and the cars disappear.  Now I know when I play the game my brain must use my weak eye in order to see the cars and play the game. This is what anti-suppression games do. \nThe huge benefit to this versus wearing an eye patch and playing the game is I‚Äôm using both eyes so training my brain to use both eyes, which is what I want to be doing. \n\n\n>Is there a special way to do that or a special game you have to play? \n\nYes, you must use and play games that are anti-suppressing your amblyopic eye, typically this is by hiding key elements of the game from the good eye using colored lenses combined with special colored games.\n\nYou will need to get your hands on some color glasses.  Here is a pair\n\nBIAL Red-Blue 3D Glasses/Cyan..\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ANJXCU2\n\nAnd play games that allow you to stop the suppression of the weak eye, like this one , when combined with the glasses.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/eye-kare/id1546432533\n\nAgain I repeat, you should talk with a professional to ensure these methods are effective for your type of amblyopia and to monitor progress. \n\n>I do play several games every week but haven't noticed any changes to my vision. I'm thinking you have to play a game with the stronger eye closed or covered?\n\nThe original way was to cover the good eye and that can be effective. However the downside is you are not training both eyes to work together if one is completely covered and there have been studies to indicate long term eye patching is not as effective as training both eyes to work together that occurs when you do anti-suppression vs full occlusion.",1643549471,t1_huu5zkn,/r/Amblyopia/comments/sfwtfa/i_have_amblyopia_at_15_years_old/huulv2n/

Where one over your dominant eye for about an hour a day, while trying to go about your life as normally as you can manage with what your vision is (you may not be able to read or make out fine details, so you may be limited to struggling to watch TV at first). This should help both with vision and alignment, because you'll be focusing on things with your bad eye, which will force it to move to focus properly. It won't fix it completely, but it's a start.\n\nMind you, I'm not an eye doctor, just someone with amblyopia. Whatever method you try, stop if it seems to be making things worse.

hplfhgm,rdkque,"We are currently working with anti-suppression techniques with my 6 yr old grandson.  It‚Äôs been a challenge to get him to understand what we are doing.  I stumbled upon  Red/Blue 3d glasses from amazon‚Ä¶ the best ones I have found so far are the BIAL brand for about $10 for 3 pairs with the case!  A Dry Erase Board and a RED dry erase marker. The Red Lense has to be over the eye that is the STRONG eye‚Ä¶ so you may have to look for a pair of lenses that are opposite to the ones I posted (my grandson is Left(RED) strong, Right (BLUE) weak‚Ä¶   \nThe way it works is by writing on the dry erase board with a red marker and any other color‚Ä¶ the RED marker is canceled out by the red lense‚Ä¶ therefore his strong eye cannot see the red writing on the board so he has to use the Right/Weaker eye to see the whole math problem. (See images in link)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mOGdb-zA1HkfdD9ATxPeKJQpqsrddqrO](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mOGdb-zA1HkfdD9ATxPeKJQpqsrddqrO)\n\nHe also has a translucent eye patch for the left eye(good eye) that we use.  What this does is makes everything on the left eye hard to see but does not block the light going to that eye so the brain still tries to use it in conjunction with the right eye(weak eye).  The weak eye then has to work a little harder to see everything but the brain is simultaneously learning that ‚Äòthis is fine‚Äô and starts to use the right eye more than it did in the past.  We usually do one set of math problem with the translucent ‚Äùforcing‚Äù the right eye to work and then do a set without the patch making both eyes work together.  The way his vision therapist explained it to me is that we have to teach his brain to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù the right eye even when the left eye is working.  \n\n\nThe therapist also gave us some red/green glasses that work with the red/green/clear bar tanslucent films.  We lay those over pages that he needs to read but the glasses are only held on with elastic and he hates using those so I opted to create my own ‚Äúreading‚Äù material with a word document and red/blue text to work with the BIAL red/blue glasses.  \n\n\nMaybe trying these techniques in analog form (not digitally on your phone/computer) you might have a little better success with ‚Äúturning on‚Äú your weaker eye.",1640202487,t3_rdkque,/r/Amblyopia/comments/rdkque/any_antisuppression_tricks/hplfhgm/

hkkw31l,qtloyn,"Wow. I‚Äôll be curious to know about this one myself.\n\nYears ago I did some work where I could have driven a forklift, but on-site vision testing and my own discomfort lead me to say I couldn‚Äôt do it.\n\nOther than moving your head back and forth to get a better sense of where the forks all from different angles, I‚Äôm not sure what to suggest. \n\nPerhaps you could set up a mock forklift at home and try some things?\n\nLining up the edges of the forks with something on the ground could help, but I imagine you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily have marks on the ground to judge by.\n\nGiven that you have the necessary skills to do the job, but your vision makes a few tasks difficult, this seems like it could edge near an ADA accommodation.\n\nI‚Äôve worked with 3D sensors, which very broadly speaking could be helpful here, but using them in a factory/warehouse environment can be tricky.\n\nAnother thought: if you can develop a process by which you can judge the forks level, line them up, and so on, then this process could help everyone at the early stages of learning to drive a forklift. You may need them longer than someone with normal depth perception, but maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîyour method could help reduce training time for others. And that has value.\n\nIn cases like ours where an impairment doesn‚Äôt qualify by many standards as a disability, we can serve as canaries in the coal mine: if a task is especially difficult for us, we‚Äôre uniquely qualified to raise the alarm (as it were) and solve the problem for others like ourselves, and possibly for many people who have good depth perception.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. Talk to the other forklift operators again, but with some different questions  One of them may have some pointers. I find there‚Äôs often one co-worker who is more conscious of how they do work, and can talk about it. At first, just try to figure out who that is.\n2. Consider what would work consistently in lining up the forks. If I recall, one problem is that the bottoms of the forks are curved, which can confuse judging distance for the flat tops.\n3. Whatever techniques you learn, WRITE THEM DOWN. Date your entries. Treat your discoveries  as techniques you can eventually use to train others.\n 4. Contact the companies that make forklifts. Someone there‚Äîa sales rep, a field tech, or the like‚Äîmay have heard of others in the same situation as you.\n\nIn short, I suggest not just working to be a good forklift operator, but working to become someone who (eventually) can train new forklift operators, and can do so with written documentation. Training that has repeatable results is valuable.\n\nYou could treat learning these techniques as a sort of second job, or a self-directed course of study (but not at the expense of family life). How do you study? What materials do you need? How could you measure improvement (such as accuracy of leveling and fork placement)? How might these techniques be used to help others?\n\nConsider that many conveniences taken for granted, such as elevators in public facilities, are there because some people needed them. Yet everyone benefits.\n\nForklifts are vital. If you can do something to make forklift operation a bit easier or quicker to learn, or if you can make it possible for more people become forklift operators, that would be a good and valuable thing.\n\nPlease keep us posted!\n\n-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nAlso, some links.\n\nhttp://www.tsaohn.org/wp-content/uploads/Depth-Perception-of-Fork-Lift-Drivers.pdf\n\nhttps://citrucks.com/blog/skills-every-certified-forklift-driver-should-have/   (Which you could demonstrate)\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1976-10-20\n\nhttps://www.certifyme.net/osha-blog/can-deaf-person-drive-forklift-need-know/\n\nA key point: we HAVE depth perception.

hkmko3g,qtloyn,"I was in a position where I needed an equipment license primarily to unstack/stack pallets. Basically, my receiving department unloads trucks, stacks pallets as high as the sun, and shoves them out onto the salesfloor. I ran out of equipment operators to deal with this mess, so I had to deal with it. I specifically went for a pacer unit because I wouldn't be putting anything into racking. I don't know how high up you're needing to go up, but stacking/unstacking got a lot better over time.\n\nThe stacking/unstacking of pallets was difficult with my depth perception and I knew I could jump off to make sure I wasn't spearing anything. I did that a lot at first - the jumping part - spearing did happen a few times though, oops. For perspective, I've always been horrible at anything requiring depth perception, especially sports. It's a miracle if I catch something, throwing is okay, but this stuff is not my strong suit, and lift truck operation fell into the same skillset.\n\nI got used to the machine pretty well over time. I only really did it for six months before I got a position that doesn't really require it, but I still hop on it from time to time because I miss it and really enjoy it. My best advice is be patient with yourself. It took me a couple months to really get used to it and the jumping on/off thing dwindled over time. I'm not the best driver in existence, but I do pretty well now. I was loading/unloading trucks and dealing with double-quadruple stacked pallets for reference. If you're going into racking, that's a different equation, but patience is the key regardless.

hgtimut,q92hue,Is that currently your best corrected acuity? \n\nIts impossible to tell you how long you would need treatment but its likely you have room to improve.

hgvl6tp,q92hue,"Question: When you went to see the eye doctor, did you go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist? My guess is you went to an optometrist, because that's what most people do. You're probably going to want to see an ophthalmologist, which is a full-fledged doctor that specializes in eyes. Unfortunately, many of them are still of the idea that nothing can be done for adults, so you may have to go to a few to find one that'll help much, but even the old-fashioned ones should do better at getting you glasses that are right for you and for making sure any underlying issues are handled as much as possible. If you need a referral (since they're technically specialists), having amblyopia should be enough to get one.\n\nI haven't done this yet myself (it's on my long-term to-do list), but look into vision therapy. You may be able to find someone who'll prescribe patching and exercises to help.\n\nIf you want to try doing it yourself, be careful and expect it to suck. For a low-key start, try VR games. Just playing them can help force your eye to be a bit more involved, and there are specific games that can help even more. I've heard that playing a version of Tetris where the board is on your good eye but the pieces are on your bad eye can help, for example. For patching, get the band-aid kind of patches (yes, they're a pain to remove, but they work best), and try no more than an hour a day to start. It will probably make you feel weird and bad (I get nauseous even just closing my good eye for awhile), and you won't be able to do much, but it might be worth a shot. But make sure you don't need to do anything REMOTELY dangerous, and don't overdo it. I'd recommend talking with the doctor first, but that amount of time should be okay if you don't/can't.\n\nI don't know if you'll get enough of an improvement to drive or not, but it might be possible.

If you have 20/20 in one eye, then you see most of the world clearly, and that‚Äôs what matters most. 3D/stereoscopic vision, visual coordination, etc‚Ä¶are important but they‚Äôre not worth getting sad about. If you want to do something about it see an ophthalmologist  who performs vision therapy for people with amblyopia. Also consider using VR vision therapy such as Vivid Vision (which you‚Äôd still have to get access to through a vision therapist).

I think the microdosing helped a lot with the anxiety of my eyes maybe not being perfect.

h7e4q5l,okmpy4,"I don't know what's up with this subreddit, but I have been sharing links to videos I have made, etc to share other options for treatment, and they never post.  I look forward to checking out this mod.  TachRayonic shared his source code and shaders from his Stereo Blocks with me, and I have made a variety of options from them.  \n\n\n[https://youtu.be/sCp7VWHQvW0](https://youtu.be/sCp7VWHQvW0)  \n\n\nI've messed up some of my own titles, and I have been making blocks to help weak left or right eyes not just for my own left eye.  So before I check out this mod, I do want to say that it has been my hope that someone might create a mod that will allow for the selection of what I'm calling ""Vision blocks"" via a UI that allows a person to check what they want like left arrows visible to right eye.  Right blocks visible to both eyes, etc....  Also I think the best benefit using Beat Saber can come from changing the blocks between every song which perhaps a mod could do automatically.  In this case a person can select whether their left eye or right eye is weak.  I also think as part of the rotation on some songs both eyes should see the blocks fully as a break.  This prevents the user from predicting where compensation is needed and theoretically I believe it will encourage actual convergence and actual countering of suppression because of the variety.  \n\n\nBut I digress.  I'm not sure when I'll even finish trying to fix my mislabeled blocks or determine where it's best to host them for sharing yet.  It's easy to modify them but trying to create so many varieties became a mind bending exercise to be sure.",1627876958,t3_okmpy4,/r/Amblyopia/comments/okmpy4/amblyopiasaber_mod_for_beatsaber_pcvr/h7e4q5l/
h7e75dr,okmpy4,"Below is a link to my video of a 99 cent game on Steam that happens to have red as it's primary color and worked perfectly with Red/Green glasses to function as a vision exercise game.  I'm sharing here since the separate post for the link didn't actually post.  \n\n\nThe cynic in me wonders if Vivid Vision isn't the moderator of this subreddit when that happens since a few simple alternatives can free people with our disability from having to spend $1000 or more for temporary access to simple games.    \n\n\nI hope it's not the case.  Clinically Vivid Vision offers additional ways for therapists to check progress, but as exercise it's simplistic gameplay can be made available for a reasonable one time game purchase price if not just simply free to begin with.  To further solidify this point Vivid Vision was crowd funded to begin with.  Disabled people supported a promising effort only to have it be bait and switched into an expensive needlessly prescription only product.    \n\n\nWhere are the legit devs with Ambloyopia and the integrity to help their brothers and sisters in need?  I'm doing what I can by reverse engineering and attempting to self-teach myself around many other responsibilities.  Sorry I always tend to rant about this.,  It is a completely inexcusable situation that didn't start with Vivid Vision.  Think of how easily red/green vision training images could be widely and feely available online and are not, and how cheaply hard copies of those resources could be made available for order and are not.  These disabilities are an area where the situation of a lack of resources and a handful of needlessly expensive options has been created by design with the money grab not the patient in mind.\n\n  \nhttps://youtu.be/FKTMfuojM9A",1627878480,t3_okmpy4,/r/Amblyopia/comments/okmpy4/amblyopiasaber_mod_for_beatsaber_pcvr/h7e75dr/
h7e9a85,okmpy4,"And below is a link to another video which I shared to this subreddit but that did not actually post.  It is me demoing a vision therapy Fruit Ninja Clone app I found on Github.  I reverse engineered the timer to 10 minutes, corrected some labels from japanese to English, tweeked the fruit velocities, etc (that still need improvement) and then added a skybox, video player, and some trees for appeal and to help encourage proper convergence even as only my weak left eye sees the fruit.  \n\n\nThis app is broken in it's current state.  It appears it has a back end which was probably for therapists to manage settings, etc.  It also appears to have at least an effort to embrace eye tracking too.  So some of the broken state may be related to the backend that is missing or at least that I'm not using.  A dev could make this a useful and distributable simple vision exercise app in a day's effort.  \n\n\nI really enjoy my DJ mixes personally especially with the haptic bass Skull Candy Crusher's I use.  So the lack of compelling gameplay isn't much of an issue for being consistent in completing a 10 minute session when I add music I like.   \n\n\nI have tons of inspiration and ideas for improving this as well as other apps, but once again I have to self-teach to achieve them.  If I was already a professional developer they'd be extremely simple to pull-off.  That's why I wonder where the decent devs with Ambloyopia are at.  \n\n\nFor example, I can simply create a youtube player which only shows up in my weak eye or I can set fruit cutting game in front of a youtube player where a person can do the exercise while also watching (or listening) to a youtube video or stream of their choosing turning something they already do into an eye exercise session.  \n\n\nI can probably pull off the youtube player simply from a unity asset.  If I can do that, why hasn't anyone else? Particularly anyone who was crowd funded by people with ambloypia to develop apps for them to use for treatment.  Every investor expected to have the ability to purchase the end result at a reasonable app price not need an prescription to rent access at extreme prices.  \n\n\nI mean my therapists suggested buying clear red clipboards and sheet protectors to turn any text into a vision exercise.  They suggested chrome add-ons for a similar purpose, as well as looking for red-green mazes.  In other words, there's no risk involved in countering suppression and encouraging convergence.  This means there is no valid reason vision exercise apps are made available only by prescription.  \n\n\nI can't help but rant.  This isn't rocket science.  It's a conspiracy, frankly.  Even with affordable and low cost apps for exercises there remains a very legitimate need for vision therapists whenever that therapist is an option.  The field of optometry doesn't have to steal to be profitable.    \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zL2wbX8a5Uk",1627879915,t3_okmpy4,/r/Amblyopia/comments/okmpy4/amblyopiasaber_mod_for_beatsaber_pcvr/h7e9a85/
h7eachv,okmpy4,"While I am at it, when I have been working with the Fruit game I have been able to use the shaders from Tachrayonic for Beat Saber notes on any object I add, but in addition I discovered the app is using a tool that has a very fascinating approach to making objects visible to only one eye.  There is a package featuring a variety of tools for transparency effects including clipping blocks.\n\nIf you have ever played a first person shooter, or really just about any 3dGame in VR then you have likely experienced clipping where your point of view passes through a wall and invisible objects become visible and some visible objects disappear.  The clipping block is a transparent block which causes this to occur at a distance in front of the player rather than at the camera itself.  So theoretically this concept may allow for a SteamVR overlay app that can turn any first person app and others into vision therapy games where the background is visible to both eyes but objects closer to the player are only visible to the the eye they select as their weak eye.\n\nThis is also a tool I think I could create through self-teaching, but steamVR overlay apps are not as self-evident and straight forward as they once were.  But I play Cubism which is a puzzle game that would be an incredible place to use this type of overlay.  Also it might work with Tetris effect which would take vision therapy exercise to the next level of enjoyment.\n\nThis isn't rocket science as proven by Beat Saber Modders.  A decent person with these skills can share their talents as an act of good will without going bankrupt or failing to feed their kids.  It's just a matter of getting the decent people with these skills on the job.",1627880657,t3_okmpy4,/r/Amblyopia/comments/okmpy4/amblyopiasaber_mod_for_beatsaber_pcvr/h7eachv/

Valve attempts to support all hardware.  Facebook deliberately attempts to block everything but their hardware with Revive being an exception that they grudgingly tolerated after failing to kill it.  \n\n\nYou cannot easily mod the Quest Version of Beat Saber and facebook is actually in the process of abandoning PCVR meaning support and enhancements are going to inevitably fade.

They work much better by default, but the creator actually shared the unity package with me so I can experiment with all sorts of combinations, and I have many coming to mind.  \n\n\nThe first one I may try is since my left eye is my weak eye, I may enable both eyes to see the right blocks and only my left to see the left blocks.

h471keu,o93j9a,"Thank you for suggesting this.  For some reason my main PC and the BISPA install are not getting along, but I was able to get these working on my laptop and using the Quest for now.\n\nThey are interesting and should be useful, but the lack of clear contrast between the colors is a disappointment.\n\nI have a lot of interesting theories for amblyopia treatment.  One of them is the fact that our brains did not actively learn to develop a lazy eye.  In fact the brain does what it does for most of us long before we can read or otherwise critically need quality vision.\n\nSo here we are trying to get the brain to learn to do things differently by forcing ourselves to attempt to read letters in spite of suppression, etc with our weak eyes.  With treat the exercises like a grind and power through them in an attempt to be consistent.  Yet we are active and striving throughout.  We were not active or striving necessarily when our brains first adapted by creating a lazy eye.  We were simply existing and the brain did its own adaptation.\n\nSo I think turning games like Beat Saber into exercise in a manner that is nearly effortless and with a game that combines that exercise with physical exercise and the real-world sense of a challenge may hold the real ticket for progress by putting our brains back into a scenario that begs for adaptation.  \n\n\nSo I plan to put in a lot of time with these custom notes and hopefully the other commissioned mod will happen too.  I have been grinding through long sessions with the red/green inserts, but with these notes I think I will make a habit of using them for every other song.  I can see the potential that the brain can connect the dots and see a need to see out of both eyes actively when a challenge reveals that suppression is not a flawless solution.  So by switching back and forth it will be less of a grind.  Also the break from the custom notes may further allow the notes to be more of a trick than a conscience exercise.  Again, I think perhaps a key to progress is finding ways that our brains are fooled into mistaking eye exercises as real-world challenges and correct the suppression as an adaptation to our environment the same way the amblyopia was an adaptation to when it came about.",1625538803,t1_h3smo9l,/r/Amblyopia/comments/o93j9a/affordable_vr_amblyopia_exercise_using_beat_saber/h471keu/
h4akrwz,o93j9a,My glasses come through the college.  They hang to the inside of my regular glasses frames normally and to use them with VR I just simply put them into the headset before I put it on.  \n\n\nI can't find any like them after several quick google searches.  The next best option might be the paper ones.  I have some basic plastic framed anaglyph glasses I purchased as a 12 pack from Amazon.  They are not comfortable to wear with the headset as glasses but it seems like they also could be used as an insert if I simply removed the arms from both sides..  \n\n\nThis touches a nerve.  The things that can help with vision therapy are generally simply and would ordinarily be inexpensive.  They apparently aren't made easily available to consumers directly simply because they can get premium prices through making them only available through optometrists.,1625613179,t1_h3bo77d,/r/Amblyopia/comments/o93j9a/affordable_vr_amblyopia_exercise_using_beat_saber/h4akrwz/

h48s55n,o93j9a,Yess I totally agree with you! Practicing in real-world scenarios is key! I found for myself that the regular eye excerciser were much too abstract for me and lacked real-world context. \n\nI had been following visual therapy for about two years before but we descided to quit because of a lack of improvement and therefore motivation.   \nAfter a few months of not having done anything special I descided to get back to it. I found out that wen walking my dog if I were to look through my (left) suppressed eye the whole perspective of the street in front of me was tilted in a very odd angle and I was seeing double a bit so the street was phasing through itself somewhere kind of looking like an X. \n\nEverything in the corners of my vision seemed to be moving away from me. I thought this experience was kind of funny so I descided to keep doing this every single day when I walked my dog since I was bored anyway.\n\nI also tried doing this in VR games such as Alyx and BeatSaber but to no real results. \n\nAbout 6 months later I descided to try watching a 3D movie in Virtual Desktop because I had heard 3D movies in VR were a lot better than in cinema's. \n\nSo I put on my very legal copy of Spyder-man Into the Spiderverse and it wasn't even terrible. I still was seeing a bit double and got a bit of a headache so I turned it off after about an hour and went to bed.\n\nThe next day however I was still seeing a bit double. This remained throughout the day. But when I went out to walk my dog that day everything just clicked! I was still seeing a bit double but the depth was there! everything around me felt like it had layers to it. And in the following days and months it just kept getting better! I now only see a bit double really up close.\n\nI experienced this for the first time in april of this year and I still feel like it is getting better every single day.\n\nI guess I could say walking my dog looking weird and watching 3D movies in VR has changed my life.,1625583618,t1_h471keu,/r/Amblyopia/comments/o93j9a/affordable_vr_amblyopia_exercise_using_beat_saber/h48s55n/
h4ak1hp,o93j9a,"I haven't watched a lot of 3d movies in VR but I have suspected it could possibly help.  Whatever you are seeing in 3D means some convergence is taking place, and it makes sense that over time that would encourage more convergence.  After all the Wow of 3D is a reward of sorts too, so even some conditioning may apply.  \n\n\nI found a vision therapy fruit ninja game on github, and I'm working with it in unity.  It was far from finished.  It would play for about 30 seconds then have to be closed and re-opened.  I found the variable in a script to extend that to 10 minutes.  I also mixed in some static balloons that both eyes can see.  I can only see the fruit with my left eye, the swords with my right, and the balloons with both.  Adding the balloons seems to make a big difference in forcing convergence, and I wasn't actually having any trouble hitting the fruit until I added the balloons.  So apparently the swords not being a fixed object meant that the fruit and swords alone were not forcing convergence.  Once I added the balloons in the mix then I could feel the effort in my eye, and had some misses because my perception of the fruit relative to the balloons was off.    \n\n\nI'm getting vision therapy through a college, but it's obvious any real benefit is going to be the result of my exercises.  I'm not about to spend a thousand or more on Vivid Vision home therapy because I'm finding solutions that are just as promising without getting completely ripped off just because I have a medical condition a greedy, crowd funded developer wants to take advantage of..  Crowd-funding compensated the devs for their efforts, and a fair and reasonable price for the software would continue to provide bonus income.  Making it a prescription product that costs over $1000 is simply theft.  Perhaps it's technically legal, but it is absolutely immoral.  \n\n\nWhere are all the decent people with amblyopia who happen to be programmers too?  There's not much to the basic apps and games.  We just need a dev who actually has ethics to create something.  If an entire new game doesn't present enough potential for fair revenue then as an act of humanity a dev could include amblyopia options into a mainstream title.  Of course the latter would involve creating something that would appeal to the mainstream.  That's easier said than done, which is another reason someone might make cheesy, simple games to gouge amblyopia sufferers for rather than apply themselves to fair profits from the industry.  \n\n\nA little vent there.  This isn't rocket science.  We shouldn't be having to try to beat the system in order to get some simple, gamified options to add to our efforts.  In fact we would probably have very effective treatments by now if people weren't making a killing off of ineffective ones currently.  We need to beat the system and kill their schemes while helping ourselves.",1625612800,t1_h48s55n,/r/Amblyopia/comments/o93j9a/affordable_vr_amblyopia_exercise_using_beat_saber/h4ak1hp/

Then he did a few sessions of vision therapy.  We were given some ""homework"" to keep doing at home between sessions.

h17936l,nw30wp,"This is a difference in philosophy commonly seen by optometry and ophthalmology. If you look at the existing literature, prescribing glasses for a patient with unilateral amblyopia (aka, amblyopia in one eye) will typically show some improvements to vision without patching. Patching will also show some improvements, potentially beyond glasses alone. Does patching ASAP result in better outcomes than glasses followed by patching later in the course of treatment? We can't say with any certainty (there is actually a study currently recruiting patients to assess exactly this question).\n\nLong story short, neither doctor is wrong. There is a chance your child's vision would have improved through spectacle wear alone. If you continue with patching, 2 hours per day is supported by the current literature (which is what your ophthalmologist recommended). In all honesty, to save yourself a headache, I would continue your care primarily with one doctor. If you continue to see both regularly, you're likely going to end up more frustrated, and potentially confused as to the best course of treatment.

h015dxg,nodt7a,I‚Äôve not had much joy with it but vivid vision could help which is VR based eye training. It works by having you play games with elements suppressed reduced or blurred in your dominant eye to help teach your brain to use them together.

h0qstok,nodt7a,"Howdy, I'm a 58 y/o amblyope who participated in a number of research studies at UC Berkeley and gained marked improvement in my stereo vision through training. The set-up employed a split screen that fed each eye slightly different images (usually that of a box) and my brain had to fuse it into a single image and I'd have to determine if the image was in front of, or behind a set point. After a year of attending sessions four times a week my stereo vision went from about 15% to 75% of normal. Visual acuity was unchanged.  \n\n\nOne day I was in the lab and a kid was playing a video game and I sorta whined that all I did was stare at boxes and the lab director said that a big chunk of the data they'd collected off me had gone into the development of that game.   \n\n\ntldr: See an ambloypia specialist as vision therapy works.",1622939339,t3_nodt7a,/r/Amblyopia/comments/nodt7a/im_21_is_it_too_late_to_fix_amblyopia/h0qstok/

If all lens options have been pursued without success, surgery is a reasonable option. As for ""very high success rate"", that depends on what you consider a success.
