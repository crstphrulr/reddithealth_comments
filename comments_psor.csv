Then, I‚Äôd paint it again, remove the nail polish and see the same pattern on the same nails. Only 4 of my nails are affected. \n\nI‚Äôm currently on terfibanine for 6 weeks since my doctor thinks is fungal related. The texture of my nail is fairly smooth, but there is also slight pitting on my left index. Interestingly, all affected fingers have an ever so slight ridge / bump at the base that isn‚Äôt noticeable by sight, but can be felt by running the finger over it.\n\nAs for medical history, I do have a tiny psoriasis patch on my scalp that flares up now and then. I‚Äôm not on any other medications aside from the anti-fungal and birth control.

i6dt1jp,ucgmw7,I have really bad scalp psoriasis plus body and it's across my face and eyes. I got started on a Otezla a few months ago but stopped after 3 weeks because of depressive symptoms. At that point I realized I needed to figure out something myself. I bathe every 3 days in minera Dead Sea salt approximately 9 cups of salt in the tub along with the shake of doctor teals so it smells good. When I get out I put on Aveeno eczema lotion it's oat based light layer it takes a minute to dry I then apply CeraVe. Same regimen for my face except I was given a bottle of something by my mom called Vitabrid C it's a lot serum for your face. I put three drops on my fingers Pat it on to my face and go over my face with lotion one more time.\n\n I got a really bad sunburn and the psoriasis exploded on my left leg so it goes from the top of my thigh down to my ankle in one huge long patch. I've started clearing the patch by doing the lotion regimen I just said plus a couple drops of the Vitabrid. I only use the Vitabrid ever few days it's a smallish bottle but lasts. I rotate the Vitabrid with an oil from a brand called Herbivore the bottle is called Emerald it's hemp based. I use it all over my body. I also use Goldfaden MD Vital Boost for my face. For my scalp I've got a serum from Zion health it's called scalp nutrition serum intense scalp revitalizer. The other thing I use for my scalp is straight olive oil. I have an olive oil sprayer and I part my hair into sections and spray it with olive oil. I do this at least once a week. Also started going to my local tanning salon which is just a tanning bed inside of a cleaners super simple tanning bed 5 min max so I don't get toasty. I also started drinking Activia Plus one bottle every night before bed. \n\nThis mouth full of a regimen lol is what I started after the otezla failed. I have not broken out in any new spots since starting this regimen and I am maintaining my current spots and some of my older ones are starting to get smaller and go away. Which I'm over the moon about! this is my first real breakout with psoriasis across my body and it's been constant for several months and this regimen is fighting it. Good luck and feel free to message me if you want to know more about the lotions. I'd like to note also the first thing I noticed was how pretty your eyes are. \n \nI'd also like to note that most makeup is going to dry your spots out and probably make it worse. Keeping the spots moisturize at all times is key to helping them heal.,1651055001,t3_ucgmw7,/r/Psoriasis/comments/ucgmw7/another_bad_day_my_scalp_is_always_the_worst/i6dt1jp/

I definitely reacted poorly to a lot of makeup ingredients, but it takes so long to figure out what's reacting that it was just easier to let it all go.  It's not that your skin is sensitive, it's that you might now have triggers to ingredients, and they're not standard triggers.  You might want to just check the ingredients on some of your foundations.  If you suspect a trigger, just start logging your symptoms and your use.

Let it sit at least 20 minutes.\n\nThis makes it easier for the shampoo to reach your scalp without penetrating flakes. \n\nGood luck,1651000909,t1_i6ayxb0,/r/Psoriasis/comments/ucgmw7/another_bad_day_my_scalp_is_always_the_worst/i6azs6s/

i6122xy,uaziwc,"Long story made really short. It's your immune system that is working overtime. Topicals treat the (skin)symptoms but once you stop using it it will come back. And most of the time pretty fast to.\n\nTreatments that targets the root cause are called biologicals (and some other treatments). Overall pretty effective but a bit pricey and in most countries only used when severe psoriasis.\n\nSteroid topicals are great for some small spots. It consist  of a few days/weeks applying followed by a short period of clean skin before starting the whole proces again.\n\nThere are plenty alternatives for a steroid cream. The problem is that the succes rate of them vastly differs at each individual. UVB, diet changes and lifestyle changes. The problem is that each person acts different tho all those alternatives. For example, no sugar might work for me, but worsen it for you (maybe not the right example, but you get my point).\n\nMy advice would be to talk this over with your dermatologist. Psoriasis on your face/hairline, as small as it is, might have an huge impact on your life. He might not put you on a biological but there are some treatments that are in-between your steroid cream and a biological but do target the root cause.\n\nMost treatments do come with downsides, just like your topical cream. Treatments that target the root cause will target your immune system (again: long story very short) Wich mean an increased risk of some hefty side-symptoms. Than again, recent studies shows that leaving psoriasis (immune disorder) untreated can be the cause of some serious bad symptoms.\n\nAny questions, feel free to ask.

i62h0jo,uaziwc,"This is more a seborrheic dermatitis comment, but I have had (mostly under-control) psoriasis for basically my whole life, and struggled quite a bit with itchy flaky scalp stuff as well. Topical steroids never really did anything for me. T-Gel shampoo is supposed to help for psoriasis; it never helped me (and it smells bad, imo). Regular dandruff shampoos (containing pyrithione zinc) never really worked either. \n\nI went to a new dermatologist after many years (like a decade), who said that I had seb derm on my scalp (not psoriasis, though he didn't look at a scrape). He recommended regular dandruff shampoos and also washing my hair every day. My hair is long and thick and that's not practical for me, and also I am fairly sure that one spot on my scalp IS psoriasis. The dermatologist wasn't interested in hearing it, so I didn't push it.\n\nI took a deep dive into what seb derm is- it's caused by a particular fungus genus, Malassezia. It is normal for malassezia to live on your skin, but imbalances of it can cause dandruff, itchy skin, and other problems. Dandruff shampoos are anti-fungal and usually work on seb derm, but not always. Coconut oil isn't good because it feeds the fungus. HOWEVER, MCT oil (medium chain triglyceride oil, derived from coconut oil) DOESN'T feed the fungus, because most MCT oil does not contain lauric acid, which is what malassezia eats. All of this to say, you can treat your scalp with MCT oil if you have seb derm. Interestingly, there seems to be some research out there indicating that relatively high concentrations of malassezia may exacerbate psoriasis (it doesn't cause psoriasis, but it's probably a nice environment for malassezia to live in). \n\nFor me, I found that the best application was to dip a q-tip into the oil and apply it to the spots on my scalp, and then rub in gently with my fingers. It actually really really helped. I put a couple of drops of tea tree oil in the MCT oil , because I like the way it smells and feels (but don't use tea tree alone- it needs a carrier oil). I was really intense about it for a while and now my scalp is more balanced. The spot that I think is likely psoriasis is unchanged (no big surprise) but whenever I am feeling itchy or flaky, I just dab a little bit of mct & tea tree oil on the spot and that helps a lot. It does make my head temporarily oily, but a) you often can't see that through my thick hair and b) it washes out. Sometimes I put a couple of drops on my scalp when I'm getting ready to wash my hair, and I think that helps too. \n\nGood luck!",1650846226,t1_i61363w,/r/Psoriasis/comments/uaziwc/just_got_off_topical_steroids_a_week_ago_and/i62h0jo/

I couldn't handle the silicone band either, and the seams from some of the woven fabric ones caused a lot of itching.  Also, with leather you can apply topical emollients to the skin itself where the leather touches if needed, like moisturizers, and it typically helps soften the leather as well (usually leather care involves moisturizing it anyway but with such close contact the special ones sold for leather may be irritating for her skin).  Also it can be waterproofed if necessary using certain natural oils and waxes as well, which may be good for her skin if substituted properly, if she so chooses.  \n\n\nBut real genuine leather made of skin is the most natural way to go and therefor the one that, IMHO, causes the least issues.

i5wabt5,ua8w2s,"Alcohol and smoking can make psoriasis worse. \n\nDon't try too many changes at once, it's usually unsustainable. While smoking is very hard to quit, it can have a big impact on your health. \n\nCod Liver Oil has been shown in double blind studies to have a mild positive impact on psoriasis. Just don't take too much because you can overdose on the vitamin A in it - as long as you're following the dose on the container you buy it in / if needed talk to a doctor about it, I don't think it's a huge concern.  I prefer it as a pill but you can get it as a liquid - if so, I've found doing a shot of it with some lemon juice makes it palatable. \n\nI want to validate, quitting smoking is fucking hard. If you can get a therapist or take nicotine alternatively (patch, gum, nasal spray etc) - do what you gotta do. There are also medications out there for helping quit alcohol, if you need that. \n\nFor other dietary changes, think anti inflammatory.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. What works for one person may not work for someone else for inflammation. \n\nMy mum's really benefitted from the Auto-Immune Protocol Diet, which is a lot of foods to cut. It put her ulcerative colitis in remission when a biologic drug & 8 pills a day could not. She's come off the pills now because her doctor said she was safe to do so. \n\nI know someone else with eczema who cut down on just wheat and saw a benefit. \n\nBodies are wild tho so your milage may vary. I personally try and eat more fish and take the cod liver and take a vitamin D supplement and that helps me a lot. \n\nAnother thing that can help with stress is mindfulness based meditation. \n\nMeditation is kinda like taking an antidepressant. One pill or one meditation isn't going to cut it - you notice it as the impact builds up over weeks. So you gotta commit to at least 10 minutes a day over a number of weeks. \n\nIf you want to get started, honestly the Headspace App is a great easy start. Or, look up John Cabot Zim - he's done a lot of work for mindfulness based stress reduction. It can help with the mind-body connection between stress and psoriasis.\n\nAnother stress reduction is some form of mild to moderate cardio exercise. It can benefit mental health which can benefit psoriasis symptoms. A fast paced walk or gentle jog a few times a week can be really good for mental wellbeing. I find it helps a lot (I have a history of major depression and panic disorder, both mostly in remission now)\n\nThis last one is a wild card - I took Wellbutrin, a Norepinephrine & Dopamine based anti depressant for a few years. While I was on it my psoriasis got better, and I found a few small studies showing that I was not alone in this. Talk to a mental health professional if you want to treat depression or explore this as an option. I took more than the lowest dose to get the benefit.

Like I said previously, most get prescribed humira because it is the cheaper one.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough anti-TNF agents have shown promise to treat inflammatory conditions, their use should be balanced by the risk-benefit ratio as suggested by the meta-analysis.‚Äù\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.746396/full",1650730373,t1_i5vcts4,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u9fh6v/anyone_had_success_with_biologics_for_inverse/i5w4hvv/

i5px4ob,u96m9i,"Seconding the ""don't dismiss steroids"" points, and I'm sure the doctor will have options. They've all got pros and cons. Targeted steroids do work well and didn't give me any lasting issues other than a little thin skin in some chronically bad spots. There are other options like pills, UV, and biologics, but your son will need to figure out which is most effective with the dermatologist as you go along. And then if you're in the U.S., there's all the insurance hoops you need to jump through to cross stuff off the list before they'll give you other meds. Fun times. What works for some of us doesn't work for all of us, unfortunately. \n\n\nAs a side note, as someone who has had psoriasis since childhood, please do what you can to allow your son some sort of control managing this himself with the doctor with your supervision. I was so frustrated with my parents, telling me when it was time for my creams and applying it, I had no autonomy, no control over my body. New medications and side effects were discussed with the doctor like I wasn't in the room. I know they did it for my benefit, but it was infuriating as a child and young teen. \n\nOf course you need to make sure he's following the dermatologist's instructions so he's taking care of himself. But appointments when my mother answered all the questions directed at me and then they all made decisions without my input was very frustrating, and I've been told it probably contributed to my control issues (including some disordered eating). Later in my teenage years, I got a new, younger, brilliant dermatologist who quickly figured out the dynamic and listened to me and helped my parents understand that I needed to be the one on the driver's seat in my treatment. \n\nI know what my parents did was out of love and concern, but as a former kid with psoriasis I guess I just like to share that perspective. It's hard enough dealing with this as a kid, even if he's not showing his concern, but he's a lucky kid that you're an interested and caring parent who's getting him to a dermatologist now instead of waiting.

i5om0nw,u8u5mm,"Check out ""hamilton health sciences low fermentable carbohydrate diet""- in pdf.\n\nI have been following it over the last 90 days, strictly to see if my psoriasis symptoms improve- however, I did not have IBD to begin with. My interest was seeing what would happen, and it was indeed a thoroughly different regime. Basically it is a type of elimination diet, which I had done before, and found very helpful in identifying the things that were triggering reactions.\n\nThe key concern for anyone trying it is a mixed outcome because you may be reacting to one of the foods in the low-fodmap list, with your particular body. However, that is not a reason to begin an elimination process on the foods you currently eat (and enjoy and will miss bitterly during the elimination and perhaps mourn as they end up being exactly the culprits... ) The lo-fodmap diet has been reported to work for some people with IBD- those would be the people who are NOT having a concurrent reaction to something they are already eating...\n\nIt requires a great deal of discipline and accounting. If you are already on a restricted diet it may be challenging to switch to new foods (however finding new things to eat is part of the fun)... to substitute- and maintain a balanced diet- and not spin out into excess sugar (15g), salt(1500mg), calories while still getting enough fiber (38g/daily). I had to use a spreadsheet and spend a lot of extra time reading labels.\n\nIt is definitely worth trying and because it completely eliminates the fodmaps, you should feel results quite rapidly. For example, I used to love onions, beans, cabbage, and garlic- so lets just say things were quieter around the house, and quickly... My psoriasis symptoms in general were on the ""getting better"" overall during the period, so I think there is something to it- but a clear result is confounded by other facts like, during the experiment, I was generally paying more attention to overall health. Also, I upgraded my suspicion one particular food I used to enjoy, the pistachio, because it was under elimination- as a fodmap. In my experience food triggers for an acute or chronic reaction is really the foods we enjoy on a regular basis, and perhaps they are a source of chronic irritation simply because we have assumed they are fine, and are not so motivated to wonder if they might be causing problems, when logically they should be the FIRST suspects. I did not want to lose the pistachio... but in the end, it had to go. \n\nBecause I went into it already under elimination to potatoes, wheat, eggs, carrots, celery, and almonds, it was tougher to build a diet that felt subjectively ""Diverse"" under the additional strictures of the lo-fodmap list, but in the end I was successful and I enjoyed it and even now as I am ending the experiment, I find myself resisting to change back after becoming accustomed to the whole low-fodmap universe, because you know what?

I've been doing gut shit for like 4 years, but it wasn't until after I did tests that I truly realized what I was fighting. I recommend two tests:\n\n* A SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) test. There aren't supposed to be many bacteria in our small intestines (SI). If you have psoriasis, there's a good chance you have overgrown colonies of bacteria in your SI.\n* A GI MAP test - these will give you which specific microbes are found in your stool (good, bad, parasites, viruses, enzymes, other health markers).\n\nThe results of the two tests together will be enough for a good practitioner to develop a reasonable treatment strategy. Definitely recommend these tests, and check out /r/SIBO when you get the results.\n\nBecause I think it's that important to say again...get tested first, and then embark on a treatment.

i5hsuue,u7yua9,"Yes. In my experience you can often get rid of a spot by treating it aggressively with a strong steroid together with calcipotriol. You can read about this [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/wiki/new-patches).\n\n**I'm not a doctor, and this is not medical advice**, but what I personally have done, and would personally recommend to others:\n\n* Apply a strong steroid such as clobetasol or betamethasone, together with calcipotriol (order doesn't matter). Apply thinly and rub into skin.\n* Cover with a good water-tight bandage and leave on.\n* Repeat the day after, and then keep doing this for 5-10 days. Stop if you experience any kind of reaction whatsoever.\n* After this phase, start applying calcipitriol daily, but with no bandage. Keep doing this daily until the skin is completely flat and clear with no sign of inflammation.\n* Then repeat the calcipotriol for 7-30 days more.\n\nThis regimen is based on several core ideas from the scientific literature:\n\n1. Covering the skin with a bandage has been shown to encourage inflammatory cells like T-cells to self-destruct. You can literally treat your psoriasis just by covering it with bandages, plastic wrap or similar, without any medication.\n2. Covering a steroid with a bandage also forces more of the steroid into the skin. This can be dangeorus in large amounts, and significantly increases the risk of side effects, but is safe in small amounts. (**Note: I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice; proceed at your own risk, and consult your own doctor if possible**.)\n3. The steroid knocks back the inflammation and could, in theory, disable enough of the Th17 cells ‚Äî which that are thought to be responsible for the ""feedback loop"" that keeps the cycle of inflammation going ‚Äî that it stops the psoriasis from coming back.\n4. Calcipotriol, a form of vitamin D, has been shown in several studies (see [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26434738), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34339017/)) to be capable of also stopping this cycle.",1650469579,t3_u7yua9,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u7yua9/advice_on_new_spot/i5hsuue/

i5i1663,u7w873,"Depends which type of light you‚Äôre getting. One causes way more tanning than the other, tho I never remember which is which.\n\nI would probably just put some sunscreen or sunblock on your tattoos. The amount of UV you get is carefully calibrated to be \*just\* enough, so any decent sunscreen or sunblock product should be more than enough to keep the tattoos safe.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is sometimes pale people get tan/hyperpigmentation where they psoriasis spots were - some of it is due to the skin being more sensitive to UV so tanning easier, some of it is due to the inflammation from the psoriasis causing hyperpigmentation. It‚Äôs usually not permanent, but you might end up looking a bit leopard-spot-y for a bit until it fades. If it really bugs you there are topical creams the derm can prescribe that help fade hyperpigmentation, but the large part of it is just trying not to get too much sun (so it doesn‚Äôt darken more) and keeping the inflammation away.",1650472796,t3_u7w873,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u7w873/how_tan_will_light_therapy_make_me_also_tattoos/i5i1663/

i5ko2wn,u7gaxa,"Not sure if any of my answers will help as guttate psoriasis isn‚Äôt my primary form of psoriasis, but \n\n1. Guttate was my third form of psoriasis I experienced, and the one that made me seek treatment more than anything. Started with plaque, then inverse, and then guttate presented on my face which was the hardest to conceal and live with at the time, but has been the easiest for my medication to keep at bay. \n2. I‚Äôm still on my first psoriasis flare up (at least that I‚Äôve known it was psoriasis) started 1.5 years ago, though I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs normal to have a flare up last this long. From what I‚Äôve seen most flare ups last 3-6 months.\n3. I‚Äôm on a biologic (Taltz) which keeps my flare ups under control for the most part. When it comes to the end of the month and I‚Äôm due for my next treatment I can see certain areas flaring back up, but not guttate. It‚Äôs usually my inverse or plaque psoriasis that starts to flare back at the end of the month. Hoping the flare ups will completely subside for a while so I don‚Äôt have that awkward 2 weeks of it starting to flare and then taking medicine and it all starting to calm down again. I think it‚Äôs worth stating I feel like I see way less advice here to seek biologic treatment, and while I do get sick a slight bit easier than I used to, overall I‚Äôve had great results and taltz only subdues a small part of your immune response (and at least in the US it‚Äôs actually an affordable medication! My insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it and I still only pay 25 dollars a month). I‚Äôd highly recommend having an open conversation with your dermatologist about your psoriasis and how it is effecting you emotionally and physically and getting the best advice you can from your doctor on what‚Äôs the best course for treatment. It took me 3 dermatologists to find one who would actually listen to me on how it was affecting my self esteem, which is an essential part of living a happy, healthy life. Also, taltz subdued my guttate psoriasis in less a month, it was my miracle medicine. There are multiple biologic medications for psoriasis, so don‚Äôt be afraid if one doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs like any other medicine, just have to find the right one for you.",1650512304,t3_u7gaxa,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u7gaxa/questions_regarding_guttate/i5ko2wn/
i5nl6cb,u7gaxa,"I'm dealing with a guttate flare up right now, never had one before, caused by strepp throat. My tonsils were extremely irritated and swollen for about two weeks and then the flare up started, taking another two weeks to fully manifest on almost my whole body. Obviously this worried me a bit since I never experienced this before, even though I had mild psoriasis before. So one month since the start of the infection I still had a slight irritation in my throat, only noticeable when I swallow. I decided to go to my doctor again (previously he thought it was just a viral infection) and ask to make a lab test of my tonsils. Two days later I got the result, yeap, strep bacteria was still present. I have no idea if they were still wreaking havoc and contributing to the guttate flare up but just in case I started an antibiotics. Tomorrow I'll be finished with the antibiotics. Meanwhile I've been doing a few UVB sessions at my dermatologist. Right now it seems like the flare up has stagnated but the damage is done sort of speak.

Otherwise something milder like hydrocortisone will be more safe than what you have.\n\nPersonally though I've been using stronger topical steroids on the face occasionally out of desperation for many years because nothing else really worked for me for those spots.,1650342116,t3_u6vjxi,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u6vjxi/duobrii_in_nostril/i5awg23/

i6hfyoq,u6vjxi,Thank you. \n\nIs that a Rx or over the counter. This is all new to me. My doctor basically just told me not to scratch and to ‚Äúcolor inside the lines‚Äù with the duodrii,1651112704,t1_i5awg23,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u6vjxi/duobrii_in_nostril/i6hfyoq/
i6iijeg,u6vjxi,Protopic needs a prescription. Hydrocortisone should be OTC but might not be too effective. There are newer topicals that may be safe and effect for the face (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u9svtn/one\_week\_of\_using\_opzelura\_topical\_jak\_inhibitor).\n\nIt is probably ok to use what you have if the psoriasis goes away for months with a couple of uses but any more is playing with fire (rebounds and skin thinning).,1651138714,t1_i6hfyoq,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u6vjxi/duobrii_in_nostril/i6iijeg/

i5ab4v8,u6ljre,"So after my psoriasis diagnosis I went to a naturopath to try and use diet and supplements to eliminate any inflammation in my system/gut.

This revealed a reaction to both types of yeast, so suspected an overgrowth of yeast in my gut (can also cause inflammation ). So I did a candida elimination diet (while also cutting out the other foods that the blood test indicated). We also added MCT oil which helps with candida. \n\nStool test to determine what my gut microbiome was up to which confirmed the yeast growth and a protozoa which can cause irritation to the gut. \n\nSo now I have some more supplements to add, and am getting a prescription for my tumtum. \n\nTLDR: best bet is to find out what YOUR system needs for nutrition/diet. Work with a naturopath/doctor if you have coverage/can afford it, or do an elimination diet to find out your triggers (brown rice elimination diet is a good one, you can find versions and instructions online).\n\nGood luck!",1650332173,t3_u6ljre,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u6ljre/diet_for_psoriasis/i5ab4v8/

i4xmoky,u4knkz,"I‚Äôve seen some earwax removal videos (listen, it‚Äôs adjacent to the ‚Äúpopping‚Äù side of YouTube) where there is a significant amount of dead skin build up. Your ear wax is supposed to slowly migrate out of your ear, taking dead skin and any environmental contaminants with it, but some types of earwax as well as those who have a lot of skin shedding in their ear canal end up with the canal blocked. If you can afford it, I‚Äôd suggest you see an audiologist, who are used to checking for ear blockages that may cause a reduction in hearing, and safely and carefully removing the build up with a range of tools. If that doesn‚Äôt immediately improve hearing, or they see you don‚Äôt have a blockage, they can assess what else might be going on.",1650095100,t3_u4knkz,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u4knkz/hearing_loss/i4xmoky/

He said it works, but I should probably go to him instead of every once in a while using hydrogen peroxide. Kind of in a dodgy manner. I suspect he just wants money from me , so he urges me to keep coming to him,  but anyway, if it's on his desk, it works.

I don‚Äôt use makeup anymore because of the hell of the flaking that comes with it. This even after going to the expensive beauty stores and buying their sensitive makeup & facial cleansers. It just never cured my issue.\n\nI wore makeup w/my costume on Halloween. Nothing crazy, no Hollywood or stage makeup, just the same thing I‚Äôd have done on a normal day when I used to wear makeup- light layer of foundation and powder, mascara, eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, using clean brushes & applicators.\n\nWell like clockwork the flaking popped up when I hadn‚Äôt even finished applying (no, not allergic, I‚Äôve tried different brands and hypoallergenic). The worst spot that I had to exfoliate regularly because of such plaquing was the corner of my mouth, I even developed a strain there from repeated flaking.\n\n\nWell! I wore makeup to Easter a few days ago, first time since Halloween, nearly 6 months. I had also thrown out all of my old make up & applicators since the Dr had said it‚Äôs a fungal infection. I used the regular kind of makeup w/new applicators and omg!!!! My skin didn‚Äôt flake!!! I was so happy!!! \n\n\nI‚Äôm not done with my treatment yet, but this makes me so hopeful!\n\n\nSide note, I‚Äôm choosing to use disposable applicators, at least for the foreseeable future, so lots of make up sponges, cotton balls, & qtips. I avoiding having anything touch my skin that will go back into a container to be used again. I want to make sure the fungal infection is really gone first.\n\n\nHope this helps!",1650496809,t1_i4u06w1,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3xfs1/psoriasis_or_eczema/i5jplty/

I've posted photos of only some of my worst areas on this thread, for reference. So yes, my immune system was absolutely attacking me and it resulted in severe plaques and scales everywhere. My dermatologist would agree with my sentiment. Palmoplantar psoriasis, which is yet another form of psoriasis I have, can lead to nail psoriasis which typically is an indicator of psoriatic arthritis, which again, is your immune system attacking your joints in a similar way.\n\nSeparately, many of your ""stickies"" provide very generalized advice that **does not work for everyone**. Namely, your advice on scalp psoriasis caused me to lose even more hair (descaling - which my derm also said was terrible advice).   This is why I try to respond to those with scalp related issues as to what worked for me, as some of the advice on here can be misleading or make those of us with severe conditions worse off.\n\n**I think it is super important everyone on this sub take psoriasis very seriously. It can become a very serious autoimmune disease that should be treated no differently than lupus or other autoimmune diseases. It causes inflammation in your body that, more often than not, necessitates biologic or other medications.**\n\nI have seen COUNTLESS dermatologists and rheumatologists in the last 12 months on these issues, and they would agree. So I think it is important we do highlight the severity here and encourage those who have moderate to severe psoriasis seek the medical attention they need so they **do not increase their risk of other diseases,** which is heightened in psoriasis patients.

i4ox0pa,u3c3rv,"Yes, the CDC description is probably wrong. The description above is true about ""classic"" autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (as well as related immune-related conditions like rheumatic fever), which do cause the immune system to attack the body's own cells as though they were foreign agents. And some web sites do describe psoriasis as a disorder where the immune system mistakenly identifies its own cells as ""invaders"" and attack them, which is a gross misunderstanding.\n\nThis simply isn't true about psoriasis, according to our current understanding. In psoriasis, the immune system dysregulation causes a cascade of immune signaling (IL-23, IL-17, etc.) that increases T-cell differentiation, including hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, which causes abnormally accelerated skin growth leading to plaque formation ‚Äî but unlike diseases like lupus where antibodies direct immune cells to attack the body's own cells, this plaque formation doesn't actually damage the tissue; keratinocyte differentiation is actually part of the wound-healing response pathway, so in a way, what you have is a form of superactivated wound healing. Last I checked, the jury was still out on any specific autoantigens that could be identified as targets of T-cell activity, which would be a key part of autoimmunity. (The closest evidence we have is of cathelicidin LL-37, which looks really interesting, but I don't think a causal relationship has been proven.)\n\nThat is precisely why many researchers instead lean towards calling psoriasis an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder these days.

i4jhgjw,u2j1ej,"I really resonate with a lot of this advice. I‚Äôve had psoriasis for 24 years in various stages and consistently the best it‚Äôs ever been is when I‚Äôve binned the steroid creams, the harsh chemical lotions and just used emollients, coconut oil and bath salts. I have one brand of prescription for emergencies which I will use when I‚Äôm having a really bad flare up and I‚Äôll use that for a day or two until it‚Äôs a bit more under control and then go back to my regular routine. \n\nI also hugely concur on the not bathing every day element, especially don‚Äôt shower everyday! I do think if you can choose a bath over a shower, always do it, your skin will thank you for it as it‚Äôs had a proper soaking rather than water running down it which I find aggravates it further.\n\nMy number one tip for someone new to psoriasis is get your skin out and get outside!! Do not cover up in the summer as tempting as it is to hide yourself away, you will only make your skin and your suffering worse! Be brave, think only of yourself, forget what anyone else might think or the inquisitive/ignorant looks and get that skin in the sunshine. Also vitamin d supplements are fantastic as well, but do check with your doctor before taking - as with any supplement you don‚Äôt want to overdo it, but for any fellow Brits I would particularly recommend vit d especially over Winter months. \n\nGreat post, OP",1649838029,t3_u2j1ej,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts_from_an_longtimer_part_i/i4jhgjw/

They should absolutely test you for strep, that could be the reason it keeps spreading. When i tested positive for strep the antibiotics halted my flares and my psoriasis has been more or less steady for a few years now, though i still have patches head to toe and no creams or amount of sunlight has ever made it better. This is a depressing disease, every day can be a challenge but time can bring acceptance. I hope in time you're able to live with comfort. Some people are able to find a treatment that helps. Many people around you do get used to it and friends will judge your character not your skin. I can't speak for love life though i've long given up on that.

i4bmvy2,u18ind,">I don't wanna take any medications since I saw they work by suppressing our immune system. \n\nI just want to note so you're aware--there have been advances in biologic medication; it used to be that any biologic medication would suppress the immune system (and I definitely found that I got sick ALL the time back then), but now there are several options that very specifically target one particular receptor and leave the rest of your immune system alone. Skyrizi and Tremfya are two medications that contain a protein that affect one tiny part (called interleukin-23 if you're curious); I have been on Tremfya for over 6 months, it instantly cleared my skin and I've been as healthy as ever. I have two kids in daycare who have gotten regular colds and flus and I haven't caught any of it, which is shocking.",1649699982,t3_u18ind,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u18ind/acting_like_i_dont_care_outside/i4bmvy2/
i4b31dg,u18ind,"Someone posted here the other day or it was in a comment, about having to explain what our condition is to people who ask.  Instead of telling them it's a rash or come up with some excuse, I educate people on what it actually is, and its helped me out a bunch mentally lately.  I'll generally tell them my immune system sees my skin as the enemy and forces it grow in a few days instead of the usual time frame like normal skin, which is about 30 days.  Sometimes I'll joke about it a little and say I've been dealt the bad hand in the gene pool lottery, and assure them it's not contagious.  I think the biggest problem for people like us, is that we care too much about what other people think.  I know that's something we can't help of course, but also our Psoriasis is something we can't help either and out of our direct control.  As I've gotten older, I've been adopting more of an IDGAF attitude about what people think.  Yeah, my skin looks like shit sometimes, but so what?  We have to live our lives just as much as they do.\n\nI haven't dealt with any kind of any shot-based or oral medication for mine, but diet adjustments have had some good effects on my flare-ups.  Sugar is kept to a minimum, don't drink much aside from water and seltzer if I want something bubbly like soda.  Fried foods are kept to a minimum as well.  I try to avoid red-meat as well.\n\nWhen it comes to ointments, you definitely need to try a few and find what works for you.  For me, salicylic acid based creams helps with my flaking.  I was recommended urea based creams by a mod on a previous post, and I've been using CeraVe psoriasis cream which has helped me a lot the past few weeks.  There's a tar based cream that I use sometimes which helps, but not as effective as the CeraVe has, Dr. Blaine's Retivaderm Psoriasis Formula.  \n\nI think the biggest thing with ointments, you need to put it on REGULARLY.  Not just once a day, but several times throughout the day.  When the directions say 3-4 times a day, they really mean 3-4 times a day.  When I wake up, ointment goes on.  I have some at work to keep putting it on spots I can reach easily like my arms, will sometimes go into the bathroom to hit my back or torso.  Get home, shower, and my fiancee helps with my back and hard to reach spots after I get out (which is important, cause the skin is soft and will absorb moisture better).  One more application right before going to bed.\n\nYour family doesn't want to see you suffer.  Have you considered asking them to help you with your ointment application instead of shutting them out?  I think it's important to let them know you do care about your condition instead of pretending you don't in front of them, and to open up and allow them to try and help if they want to.  Even the littlest bit is good for their own mental health, as well as yours.  I used to shut people out about it, but my fiancee accepts it and knows that kind of suffering we go through.  There's still a person under all the flakiness and redness, and that's who our loved ones care about most.",1649692461,t3_u18ind,/r/Psoriasis/comments/u18ind/acting_like_i_dont_care_outside/i4b31dg/

I used to be really bad at making sure I have my ointment on and would flake everywhere.  Doing it several times throughout the day and finding ones that work well, there's like 90% less flakes around my house.  Try to make it more routine and it'll start to make a difference.  And don't be afraid to ask for help!  I used to try to just put ointment on myself, but if your family knows it's going to help, they won't mind at all giving you a hand and will only want to help more.  It'll help give your mom an outlet to her feelings as well.  The reason she cries is because she feels helpless.\n\nIf you ever get the chance, try to follow up with a dermatologist or a rheumatologist.  Like someone else commented biologics have come a long way.  Dermatologists deal specifically with the skin, but if it's severe you may have psoriatic arthritis down the line which is where a rheumatologist comes into play.

i40s90a,tzq8do,"Yes. I went through a bad patch about 6 months ago. Tried to grow my hair out, P got real bad and then I tried to keep it long to hide the P. Bad move.\n\nDecided to just commit and shaved it all off to a blade 2. Was able to get rid of it in a matter of weeks by applying cocoscalp directly onto my scalp and leaving an hour or two, then rinsing it out. Applying Nizoral or Sebizole 2% to my scalp, leaving that on for 10 minutes or so before I washed it out in the shower. Would sometimes use Tgel after that as it smells better than the other two and is neutral enough to not cause anymore flare-ups. Never use shampoos that are perfumed, does not do you any favours. \n\nAfter that I would apply betascalp lotion to my scalp but you'll need that on prescription. It will hurt like a motherfucker too the first few times if you've been scratching and have cuts due to the alcohol in it\n\nEdit - In short, shorter hair means it's easier to treat and I have personally found it doesn't flare up as bad..probably due to more sun getting directly to your scalp",1649502926,t3_tzq8do,/r/Psoriasis/comments/tzq8do/getting_short_hair_helps/i40s90a/

I usually go on a month or so of vit d supplement until the sun starts doing its thing again, combined with topical salve, cream doesn't seem to keep the skin hydrated enough so I prefer salve. Keep your skin hydrated with moisturiser and try to get as much sun as possible this time of year! Especially important to moisturise after showers as the water dries out the skin. \n\nI know a lot of people praise diet changes and whatnot to curbe the P, but if you're like me and only get more stressed out trying to ""cure"" your P with diet and exercise it's better for your mental health and stress levels to not worry too much about that. It's easy to say not to stress about the P but since you know it can clear up I'd say at least don't let it eat you up.

Of course you can get a sunburn which is no good. You probably already know that you need to be careful when you take high doses of D as you can also through off your PH balance and get too much calcium in your blood. I‚Äôve heard you can/should balance vitamin D with K to help with the PH levels. But of course consult your doctor on this. 1,000 iu seems to be what most people on this sub takes.

The doctor didn‚Äôt seem very concerned and it was fairly mild pitting so other than being self conscious I didn‚Äôt think too much about it.

I just learned about psoriatic arthritis and I‚Äôm pretty concerned. I will be making an appointment in the morning. Recently my nails have gotten worse and I have tried antifungals with no success. Looking at photos online I think it may be psoriasis. I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis but considering the countless doctors who have dismissed my pain over the years and possibly misdiagnosed me, I guess I‚Äôd like some validation and support before I go to yet another doctor.

To test this hypothesis, 56 patients suffering from long-standing plaque psoriasis were randomized to receive either active treatment (electrostimulation by needles placed intramuscularly, plus ear-acupuncture) or placebo (sham, 'minimal acupuncture') twice weekly for 10 weeks. The severity of the skin lesions was scored (PASI) before, during, and 3 months after therapy. After 10 weeks of treatment the PASI mean value had decreased from 9.6 to 8.3 in the 'active' group and from 9.2 to 6.9 in the placebo group (p < 0.05 for both groups). These effects are less than the usual placebo effect of about 30%. There were no statistically significant differences between the outcomes in the two groups during or 3 months after therapy. The patient's own opinion about the results showed no preference for 'active' therapy. It was also clear from the answers that the blinded nature of the study had not been discovered by the patients.

i3egws1,twahlz,">	Are you able to be completely nude while doing the treatments?\n\nNo, absolutely not. Phototherapy is considered very safe, but is linked to genital cancer (such as squamous cell carcinoma), especially in males. It is very important to wear opaque clothing around your private parts.\n\n>	How long did it take for you to notice a difference?\n\nPhototherapy is a slow process where the dosage will be increased with each session until you reach the optimal dose. People typically need more than a month of exposure to get good results. The good news is that phototherapy confers much longer remission times than pretty much any other treatment. People who do phototherapy three times a week for 2-3 months typically see complete remission that lasts 6-12 months.\n\n>	Does it help with scalp psoriasis?\n\nYes, but if you have hair, much of the light will be blocked from reaching the scalp. There are handheld phototherapy devices (especially a newer type called excimer laser) that do reach the scalp, but you shouldn't assume that your phototherapy clinic has them.",1649105420,t3_twahlz,/r/Psoriasis/comments/twahlz/questions_about_phototherapy/i3egws1/
