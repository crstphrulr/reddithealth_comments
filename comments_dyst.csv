I have CD, I totally understand, (as you say) you might feel a bit ""better"", shower, dressing, doing your hair the best you can; and Boom- energy gone. Then for me, anger sets in that I can't do shit, I no longer have any normalcy. I sit and watch the world pass me by, hence depression. I'm on the ""best""  stuff for that, Prestiq 100mg. I feel like that has made a big difference but there is not any medication in existence thst can take all the depression away.....\nI do have Botox shots and ¬Ω way through, c trigger point injections. I'm on 2 types of muscle relaxants 1-zanaflex 3x a day 4 mg. 2-baclofen 20mg 3x a day. My doctors know I take that (baclofen) prn because it can make me piddle my pants. Quite embarrassing when you're in public and/or at night with that cough. More times at night it happens when I go to get up to use the restroom. My boyfriend of 15yrs asks me what are you doing as I get clean underwear and wash up. \nI'm on 2mg of Klonopin which is newly added over the l couple months. Oh my, why didn't they start me on this sooner?!?! I can feel the tightness in my shoulders let up. I hope they never take me off this because tears will be shed! I'm on gabapentin (2400mg a day) for 2 things. 1- fibromyalgia and 2- I've been losing mobility in my left arm, accompanied with pain. Most of the time it stays in the back of my shoulder to my bicep. Lately, is been going to my wrist. I have to go in for an x-ray for that. Baby steps with that.\n\nOops, didn't mean to publish yet, hence edit:\n\nI'm also on ibuprofen for inflammation 800mg, 3x a day. \nTo sleep, I'm on trazadone 100mg and Lunesta 3mg. On top of all this, they had me on Seroquel. That knocked me on my ass and all I did was sleep. Needless to say, I had to go off that, no questions asked! \n\nMy neck decides on a daily basis which way it'll turn and how far. I've learned to hide it with the way I sit, and people can't tell as much. I look at all my meds and that depresses, frustrates me, and I can't help but think is this really my life now? I'm 49 years old. I used to be so active. It saddens me to say that this is taking it's toll on my relationship. He wants to go be social, as do I, I just can't sometimes, or it'll be a shortened time as I can't handle the pain. I do have 2 different types of pain pills but my mgs aren't enough and the doctors refuse to increase it anymore. I'm on low doses, I have to look at it as, some is better than none. \n\nI haven't worked now in 2yrs. Hopefully within the next 2 weeks I'll be dipping back in the workforce, working from home.

i55x4a7,u618q4,"Ouch. I've had that kind of dystonia in my feet, it's really uncomfortable, I can't imagine having to work on your feet with it. If you haven't already, see if you can get a doctor to check for Dopa responsive dystonia (can usually be done with a trial of a medication called L-dopa). It's a rare condition which often gets missed by doctors. It may be a long shot but what you're describing is exactly how my feet were and that type of spasming, position your foot is in and the tremors is a common presentation of it. If it is, then it's treatable with medication. If you want more information on this feel free to PM me.\n\nIf it's not, you might be able to get the weight off your foot through the knee thing they give people with broken ankles (it's like a platform you kneel on with one leg and a stick with to the ground). I'm not sure what your job is but if there's any way you can get off your feet more, like sitting on a tall stool, let your employer know you have a medical condition and they can hopefully help re-structure things a bit to help you. If sitting down I used to stick a pencil under my toes to take the pressure off from some of the toe curling. Sometimes a splint holding the foot straight can help (make sure it's well padded) but still keeping weight off it as much as possible. Massage and using your hands to hold your foot in more comfortable positions for a bit can also help.\n\nFor PT make sure whoever you see has experience working with movement disorders/dystonia, if they treat it like it's foot pain/mobility issues from another cause it can make it worse and cause you more pain (if they put you on a treadmill find a new PT). It might be helpful to see what medication options you have that can help relax the muscles and ease the pain, it's a lot easier to work with the muscles in PT or splint them when they're not in complete spasm. I've found anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofen can be helpful. \n\nI really hope you're able to get some relief.",1650250853,t3_u618q4,/r/Dystonia/comments/u618q4/foot_dystonia_and_mobilty/i55x4a7/

i2vtxk7,tsnq5z,My husband had some success using the Farias technique and mindfulness meditation. Ultimately he found meditation more useful than Farias I think.,1648753156,t3_tsnq5z,/r/Dystonia/comments/tsnq5z/farias_technique_or_feldenkrais_for_dystonia/i2vtxk7/
i2vxa81,tsnq5z,"I've done Farias since onset of symptoms 13 months ago (along with standard medical treatments). I believe the following things are all true:\n\n1. The people who are held up as examples of becoming symptom-free under his program are part of that 10 percent who would recover anyway.\n\n2. The program suffers from the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy. In other words, if you aren't seeing drastic improvements, you must not be truly following the program. (In other words, I believe that he believes in his methods, rather than being a con man)\n\n3. Learning to calm your mind, stimulate the vagus nerve, and accept the new challenges in life are all critical for surviving with dystonia (particularly early onset), and the program helps a good deal with that.\n\n4. There is something to neuroplasticity. I had jaw surgery in 2015 (way before dystonia), and never regained feeling in in my lower lip. The surgeon at the time said that if it wasn't back in a year, it never would be. I've regained about 80 percent of feeling in my jaw while working his remapping exercises- which hasn't helped my dystonic symptoms (torticollis to the left), unfortunately.\n\nThe time commitment is real, but I don't find it excessive since a lot of it is passive, and I have a lot of time anyway since dystonia has cost me so many hobbies and activities. I currently put in 15 minutes of breathing when I first wake up, 30 minutes total before work of eye exercises, listening to therapeutic music, and remapping exercises, a 20-minute walk during lunch, and a couple 5-10 minute breaks during the day for some shoulder exercises. \n\nMy confidence in the program waxes and wanes depending on how I'm doing at any particular moment, but I keep on it because if it even boosts that recovery rate possibility from 10% to 11%, it's worth trying. I've done an online seminar with Farias, too. Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions.

i357zuw,tsl4jt,"Years ago, I reached out to Fred Johnson. While he is very knowledgeable, and as helpful as can be, even he told me that he could not help me with my case because I had not worked in 10 years. The deal with social security/disability is that you must have worked so many hours and the previous 10 years. The year 2006, I had my first child and quit my big corporate job, to stay home and raise my son (and nearly 14 months later, my daughter, as well). My CD was triggered in 2010 by a second car accident within a year & a half of the first. I saw 22 specialists of all kinds, in only 7 years - knowing that what I was experiencing every single minute of every day, wasn't just Fibromyalgia. \n\nWhile, I do have that as well - I knew that this constant, unrelenting pain, focused solely in my cervical, upper back & shoulder area couldn't be only Fibromyalgia. Something inside told me to keep searching for an answer. So - I saw a Motor Movement Neurologist, and was diagnosed after only being in the exam room with him for 5 seconds. They had also taken X-rays when I arrived at this office, and he pulled them up on his computer, confirming his diagnosis. He was able to tell by the way my left shoulder was raised, my head tilted toward my right shoulder & by the tremors that I was experiencing in my right shoulder, arm & hand.\n\nI was diagnosed one month short of having not worked for 11 years. When I spoke with him, he said that because of that one fact, I would not be able to receive any Disability benefits or Social Security benefits. It was truly frustrating, as I had done so much research and I was an advocate for my own health - finding many of the specialists that I saw, on my own. To add insult to injury, I am allergic to Botox (and steroids). The Motor Movement Specialist that I had seen, good me that there's was nothing else that he could do for me and that I needed to find a Pain Management Doctor. \n\nHere I am, 5+ years later, unable to work - with a brain that is 100% functional, creative & wanting to be utilized. And a feeling of guilt that haunts me, feeling like I am not a good enough wife, mother, daughter, friend...and to top it off, I do not bring any income into our household. On the other hand, I have a body that is never without pain + the Depression that goes along with chronic pain. I have become a rockstar at hiding how my body feels on the insides, and to show a chipper, upbeat disposition - with a touch of sarcasm, b the kind of honor that my (now) teens, 14 + 15, love.\n\nI hope that your wife has better luck than I had in finding disability assistance, and my heart aches for her, having to go through life with this terrible condition. Reach out if you ever have any questions, or, if your wife just needs to talk to someone who understands. It truly turns your life upside down - and it is so important to think of the positive things, b/c thinking negatively will quickly send her down that terrible spiral of deep depression.\n\nIt is great that you are seeking out information for her - you are her rock. It is just as difficult on the spouses to see what their loved ones have to experience, on a daily basis - and the toll that it takes on them - and, yourself - having to pick up the extra slack, and trying to be understanding But, the woman that you fell in love with is still in there, though it can sometimes be difficult to see. She is there, and you can help her bring that side of of herself out, by being as supportive & helpful as you can be. My husband is nothing short of amazing. He is here to talk to (although, I highly recommend that she talks to a therapist, regularly - I talk to one weekly, who is local, but we do Telehealth visits b/c they are that much easier on me. Seeing her is worth it's weight in gold), to pick up my slack...I cannot do the simplest of things (wash my hair, COOK! - b/c stirring is torture on my shoulder + all surrounding areas, for days. Vacuuming is a really bad one, wiping off countertops...or, doing anything to cause my right arm and shoulder to do too much, etc., etc., etc - the list goes on for days). \n\nI wish you both much luck...and, again - don't hesitate to reach out, or to have your wife reach out - as support is vital.

I know people say you should reduce stress, but sometimes that's not possible so it would be better to find ways to deal with it mentally. I've found that cognitive behavioural therapy works quite well, so I would suggest that you find a good therapist that you gel with. Remember dystonia can also cause stress because  the disease management can be tricky, DRD specifically constantly progresses so as soon as you think you've got this it throws something at you that you didn't expect. So, I see a therapist regularly to help me manage my stress and emotions around the illness. It makes a big difference.\n\nI would say having DRD makes your life fairly demanding. At least in my view, it is a full time job to maintain a maximum of 60% functionality compared to an ordinary person. Most days I'm not even reaching that goal and it's easy to fall into negative thoughts when that happens.\n\nLastly, I recently discovered GABA.

See info on it here: [https://www.botoxsavingsprogram.com/](https://www.botoxsavingsprogram.com/) \n\nEven without the savings program, the cost of Botox can vary a lot by where you get it and/or the specialty pharmacy you use. I used to see a neurologist at a hospital, and their negotiated rate with insurance was something like $1800 for a 100 unit bottle (not all of that cost was passed on to me).

I keep telling myself, it could be worse and at least I'm able to get around. Sometimes showering is impossible because I can't lift my arms and the pressure from shampooing hurts my neck beyond belief. \nI'm in therapy right now because my temper isn't what it used to be, so I go and vent to her.

hwwsmqs,ss1wjw,"Piggy backing a bit on others.\n\n\- Botox is always going to be trial and error process in the beginning regarding placement and dosage. There are real pro/cons and I really want to encourage you to research it. For example, repeated Botox can eventually cause muscle wasting. Your body at some point will become immune to it‚Äôs affects. Not to say it isn‚Äôt worth it. I will take ANY relief over no relief.\n\n\- While CD research is still in early stages (underfunding and lack of awareness) they have pinpointed some of the causes: genetic, basal ganglia dysfunction, physical trauma, side effects of certain medications, or brain lesions. If your doctor is suggesting Carb/Levo, they may be trying to determine if your CD is caused by basal ganglia dysfunction. This med is mainly used for Parkinson‚Äôs. Why? Because Parkinson‚Äôs is typically caused by the basal ganglia. Research has shown it can help with CD if the root cause is BGD ‚Äî but not in every case. Please understand, I‚Äôm not suggesting you have PD or will develop PD at any point. I‚Äôm explaining why they are offering the med. \n\n\- If you chose to try Carb/Levo, there‚Äôs no reason why you couldn‚Äôt also do botox. Did your doctor pose it as an either/or situation? For some people the med is a miracle. Personally, I couldn‚Äôt get past the side effects to notice if it was helping or not. Although I did find out later my doctor started me on too high of a starting dose rather than a step up program he was supposed to do. My advice here is to ask your doctor to do the step up if you are going to try the med.\n\n\- Does your doctor have you on any other medication? Baclofen is a popular choice although it seems to be hit and miss ‚Äî either it really helps a person or it does nothing at all. Klonopin, Tizanidine, Clonozapam, etc. You don‚Äôt mention whether there is pain associated with your movements, but if there is I suggest getting a pain management specialist in additional to the movement disorder specialist. The MDS will be limited on what types of meds they prescribe for pain and/or spasms whereas the PMS has much more ability. Only recommendation is to call around to different offices to find one who is at least familiar with CD or they may not take your pain seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and I‚Äôm glad to hear the Botox is helpful this round!",1644848379,t3_ss1wjw,/r/Dystonia/comments/ss1wjw/cervical_dystonia_carbidopalevodopa/hwwsmqs/

I ended up having to go on an anticholinergic to treat my cervical dystonia which does have noticeable side effects. \n\nIf C+L does help it can be pretty dramatic and pretty fast in some cases (in one week I went from having completely cramped up feet to basically normal feet) and it won't wear off like botox.

It is painful most of the time for me to talk because of how restricted my throat becomes after i start speaking. I choke on most things I eat or drink. I choke on air sometimes lol my throat spasms at just the right (wrong?) time and cuts the swallow of whatever I am consuming short and then I am not prepared for the other part of it so fast that before I know it, I'm choking/down the wrong tubing it.

Looking to the centre has improved a lot for me during the day, but at night its all over and I struggle to sleep, massive tension in my SCM.

With CD, the muscles are overactive -- so when we try to do those small adjustments the muscles overcompensate and cause a rebounding effect. It really helped me once I understood that's what was happening. \n\nOne thing that will help with the movements is to work *with* the muscles. Research ""null point cervical dystonia"". The basic idea is there is a neck position that is agreeing with the overactive muscles and can limit the movements. For me, the most effective one is tilting my neck slightly to the right (my issues on the left). It doesn't prevent my movements 100%, but it has dramatically reduced the frequency.\n\nSleeping is hard for a lot of us.

If neuroleptics remain a crucial element of an individual's health, a class of newer, ""atypical"" neuroleptics (such as clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine) may be a suitable substitute. Anticholinergics (such as trihexyphenidyl and benztropine) and muscle relaxers used to treat other forms of dystonia may also be helpful. Baclofen and clonazepam are also sometimes used to treat tardive dystonia. Botulinum toxin injections to a particular muscle group are an additional option for treatment.\n\nLike the treatment of tardive dystonia, the treatment of other tardive dyskinesias is very specific to the individual patient. The first step may be to gradually minimize or discontinue the use of the offending medication. In many cases, discontinuing or lowering the dose of the causative drug will ease symptoms. Substitute drugs may be recommended to replace neuroleptics. In some cases, the symptoms will persist after use of the drug has been terminated but with careful management, symptoms may improve and/or disappear with time. Other drugs such as benzodiazepines, adrenergic antagonists, and dopamine agonists may also be beneficial.\n\n----\n\nI got a promethazine prescribed to me for migraine nausea and I never even filled the script because I read all the side effects.

huloivc,se1911,"Hey u/Sonya_Blade_0907, quick question. If u get the chance to try it, I would love to hear your experience of it. It is easy to do and anyone should be able to do it but always listen to your body and don't do anything that worsens... that's never my intent.\n\nIf you get a chance, try to lay down on the floor on your back. Then try ""deep breathing"" as an exercise, meaning try to keep repeating it for 4-5 minutes. Does it feel weird? Does it feel sore? Does it flare up symptoms?\n\nIf it does, what does the pain or discomfort mean then? Is it because there's sore tired muscles around the chest? Is it cuz of adhesions? Is it cuz of dystonia? Fibro? Who honestly can know for sure and tease it out?\n\nThis is how my ""pain journey"" started, after discovering that laying on my back and trying to do wim hof breathing caused me discomfort and pain symptoms that I never knew would happen if I lay on my back and do breathing exercises. That was back in fall.... and I learned i had a bunch of tender areas around my front rib cage and sides of chest and even some areas of my back. \n\nBut this is only the first part, you are 100% right that if done aggressively, symptoms worsen and care cause a flare up. I actually then tried to massage away the sore spots on my chest wall and ended up hurting myself with a percussion massage gun cuz I was too aggressive on myself. That is how I ended up discovering a chiro who really helped me out (for my bruised rib and chest muscles) but then I started noticing other changes with how my body felt its surrounding (my left foot can feel the ground more), my posture, and how I was moving. Changes were subtle at first and any improvements I experience nowadays are very subtle but compared to where I was at in terms of functioning, emotions/mood relating to pain, and especially my thoughts on my own pains (mostly fear or denial or guilt or shame) were also improved.\n\nI cannot share everything at once cuz this all sounds weird af. I know that what I share will only trigger other ppl in pain into thinking I'm out to get their money or I'm some quack sick doc that gets some sorta sick pleasure in tricking ppl on reddit.\n\nIf you look at my old posts, you will see how I'm trying to figure out how to deliver my story and own personal experiences in a manner to try and help others. I get that my pain experience is way different from others, just like how my identity is not the same as other people's identity. That is why I'm here trying out different ways to share and figuring out how to best offer some comfort for this subreddit that there is a doc on here trying to figure it out for himself and hopefully come up with simple, safe, and caring suggestions to help ppl suffer a lil less (physically or mentally and especially both). \n\nJust trying to figure out how to serve ya'll better",1643388252,t1_huirzs9,/r/Dystonia/comments/se1911/faith_series_post_1_brain_body_connection_it_can/huloivc/

hun5o0o,se1911,"Unfortunately the worst thing you can do for cervical dystonia is to lay flat on a floor. The neck, trap and shoulder muscles are already in constant spasms and tension. By laying flat on a floor a person with CD will only end up hurting themselves. I hope this will help you understand CD a little better. \n\nBut there is a way to do it and do it right, which I have learned from my PT therapy clinic that specializes in movement disorders. Just letting you know so you know where I am coming from. I do this during my PT session: \n\nI lay on a ""massage"" table with a PILLOW under my head - the pillow.is a critical part. Those dystonic muscles have to be supported at all times! The pillow is maybe 2 inches tall - don't use regular pillow that you sleep on that could be overstiffed. I bend my legs to take the pressure of my spine, both thoratic and cervical, and put a roll support under my knees - I have yet to find those so at home I stack some pillows and rest my legs like that. You want something that will put your neck in a neutral position. I do slow rolling head tilts back and forth like if I were looking behind me and back to neutral position. After few reps of those I lay flat with my hands on my stomach and relax for a couple of minutes. \n\nAnother excercise which also requires a PILLOW is on a weight lighting bench. You set the bench to about 35 degree angle and lay on your back on it with a pillow under your head. You can also use a towel folded in a square if the pillow slides too much. Their equipment is professional but looks like something that was made for prison ü§® - hospitals, go figure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The bench they have has a rest for your feet and the bench goes up and down so he has me push up and stay in that position while I do the tilts and head raises. This is also doable with a regular weight bench at 35 degree angle or less - whatever feels the best. After few sets of those I let my arms just fall to the sides and let the gravity do the work. It feels relaxing and good. \n\nLast one is laying on a long fat foam roller, again with a small pillow or a folded towel, and let your arms fall to the side and just lay there for as along as it feels good. \n\nFor CD these are the best ways to practice some relaxation, and if you wish, breathing excercises.",1643408350,t1_huloivc,/r/Dystonia/comments/se1911/faith_series_post_1_brain_body_connection_it_can/hun5o0o/

hu5xgid,sc4ex4,"Hey disabledmurderino. I started symptoms about a year ago and was diagnosed shortly after.  Yeah, I often tell people that whenever they talk to me, they should be aware that I'm fighting my neck, physical pain, and the black dog. I'm not sure if you have kids, but one of the hardest emotional issues, particularly at first, is whether I would embarrass my kids and wife to be seen in public with them. We're a big Disney family, and that first month was filled with thoughts like ""I can't take my kids to Disneyland like this""- although I think we're planning to make my first attempt in May. So, yeah, this hits physically, socially, emotionally, spiritually, mentally, at least for me.",1643125388,t3_sc4ex4,/r/Dystonia/comments/sc4ex4/has_dystonia_changed_you_emotionally_or_mentally/hu5xgid/
hu3ziyq,sc4ex4,I have a number of other physical maladies I no longer care for. Does that count?,1643083355,t3_sc4ex4,/r/Dystonia/comments/sc4ex4/has_dystonia_changed_you_emotionally_or_mentally/hu3ziyq/
hu4k8wv,sc4ex4,"Friend,\n\nI cannot claim understanding of the suffering you are experiencing while trying your best to function in life.\n\nI want to applaud you for your keen self-awareness of your mood/emotions and how they are affecting your thinking during negative states.\n\nI also want to say I really respect you for adopting the attitude of humor when people stare. It shows you have an understanding that when your body is expressing itself in public, that any discomfort experienced by onlookers who don't understand medicine and the fact that in nature, not every body is the same... it's just a social construct that the majority of people follow cuz that what they were taught. Life has clearly taught you (and is still teaching you) very different but more meaningful and deeper lessons as a result of your condition.\n\nI think it was Emerson who said the law of compensation (one of nature's many definite laws) where if you gain something, you lose something. If you lose something, you gain something.\n\nRegarding your observation of emotional numbness cold hearted experiences, I believe there is something to everyone's perceptions of their experiences. I also believe that people's perceptions of their experiences, and the meaning they attach to them are a choice to be considered with care. Words like ""emotional numbness"" or ""cold hearted"" appear to have a negative connotation to your experience of that emotion itself... and you are obviously a humorous person so it would make sense to be puzzled, a little bothered, or even a little scared of this experience (or a lot scared for some). \n\nI wonder if this numbness is similar to what I had personally experienced and used to think of as apathy. I have hypermobile ehler danlos syndrome and so I don't heal well due to defective connective tissue. I took many risks, got into 3 car accidents and a motorcycle accident, wrestled in high school and you get the idea. My experience of multi-joint and multi-muscle injuries is that my injuries never seemed to completely go away and they would randomly flare up at times (usually due to emotional stress or using my body the wrong way). I believe these areas of prior injuries form adhesions which contribute to the whole fibromyalgia phenomena. I say phenomena because fibromyalgia is not a specific disease caused by known factors that can be seen or tested for w/ current medical tech (like viruses or bacteria).\n\nAnyways, I developed worsening stiffness with loss of range of motion in various joints and areas of my body, including varying patches on my thoracic cavity. My neck was weird cuz right side muscles were very sore and I later found out my left side muscles in my entire body were weaker and more quiet. I describe this level of detail to try and give you a picture of what I believe was causing my ""apathy episodes"".\n\nThere were times when I try certain movements and my body lets me know I cannot do that movement by numbing my mind and causing some sorta fog. They even have a phrase for it called fibro fog. For whatever reason, my body symptoms seem to signal to my brain and my brain seemed altered or not able to process it and it leads to some sorta stress on the brain that causes it to want to block the signals... that's my best guess at what happens with me.\n\nI don't treat dystonia patients and I don't give medical advice on reddit but I have seen a few dystonia patients in training and in my current line of work (serving disabled US veterans as a medical disability examiner). I suspect the body, the ability to move properly, and range of motion really contribute to brain health. It's not possible to know for sure (chicken or egg, which first?) but it may not matter since I also suspect that it goes both ways.. both the brain and the body have defects that play on each other and create a feedback loop of confusion and discomfort.\n\nI hope you are always able to stay truth to your sense of humor and positivity. There are a few things I would recommend from a wellness standpoint (again not medical advice). One thing I suspect that is similar in both dystonia folk and folks with fibromyalgia (which again I think is not a specific disease but a result of a bunch of trauma that is physical or mental or both), is that their over use injuries from repetitive movement or lack of movement profoundly affects the way they breathe while performing different functions of every day living. If you want quick proof of this, if you are ever doing something and you feel pain symptoms that are constant during the act (like back pain from sitting for prolonged periods), take a deep breath try humming for as long as you can and keep repeating this and see what happens. A google search will explain why it happens but basically the theory is humming creates vibrations that stimulate the vagus nerve which feed backs to the brain via parasympathetic nervous pathway (the rest/relax pathway that is opposite to the fight/flight sympathetic pathway). This is one of many examples of how certain use of body or body movements influence the nervous system and brain.\n\nThis post is an essay so I want to end with this. Try out wim hof breathing technique, he teaches one of his techniques for free on youtube. If you find benefit, I recommend trying his paid course as I found it personally immensely beneficial since he introduces 3 techniques to have a degree of control over your body's own physiology and chemistry, namely via breathing exercises, cold exposure, and stretching/moving in a way to condition your body.\n\nI am in the process of starting a youtube channel to try and teach concepts about pain that will hopefully allow people to use their pain experiences in a manner that helps more than it harms. I went into medicine to help myself and other be in less pain so we can live more. If interested, free to follow me as I will keep posting and will update with future channel postings. I don't want this to get flagged as self promoting but just want to offer this option for you if you actually read this far and enjoyed or thought it was helpful.\n\nMuch peace my friend, you are dealing with complex symptoms, your brain is in a more stressed state than the average person so your brain is stronger and can tolerate more than the average person. Can you imagine if you take the average Joe of the street, give him dystonia for a week or months or years and see how they cope? Would be a disaster. But you my friend, you are functioning and looking for answers and community. Keep at it, keep thinking in terms of what is helpful or not. If your brain needs a break and has to fog or numb or be still for awhile, might just let it be and continue enjoying life as best as you can.\n\nBesides Wim Hof, check out Napolean Hill's book ""Think and Grow Rich"" and ""Outwitting the devil"". Even if you don't care about being rich, Think and Grow Rich is not some get rich quick scheme but actually a step by step instruction on how to use the power of the mind in very helpful ways rather than harmful. Outwitting the Devil is an amazing book that shows how the mind can work against us by no fault of our own other than poor teaching by the environment and/or immature selves with developing brains. Keep looking for wisdom that brings you more peace and helps your cause. Keep up the good fight my friend and let me know if you found any significant benefit from any above recommendation... they're just the starting point and each topic goes much deeper into the mind and body if you are willing to practice joyfully and patiently endure through failures.\n\nOh and you might want to check out Mark Manson (twitter, YT, books), that dude is an incredible sage and a big source of peace and wisdom for me. I'm still learning and growing too\n\nLastly, I adopted Wim Hof's 3 rules for his courses into 3 rules for my own life. 1) don't force yourself to do anything. 2) Listen to your body. 3) Be playful and have fun.\n\nMuch love,\n\nDr. FF",1643095443,t3_sc4ex4,/r/Dystonia/comments/sc4ex4/has_dystonia_changed_you_emotionally_or_mentally/hu4k8wv/

hxdvxug,sc4ex4,"Yes. Yes it has. I was diagnosed with hemi/functional Dystonia (my Neurologist‚Äôs aren‚Äôt sure which one. I‚Äôve been re-diagnosed with functional Dystonia in my late teens but I don‚Äôt trust my Neurologist) when I was 10 years old. I was a really happy, talkative and outgoing child. I had loads of after school activities. I used to do karate, horse riding, violin lessons, music theory, acting, singing, etc. I had to stop all of it because it started to spread from my right foot all the way up to my shoulder. I still went horse riding for around 3-4 years longer because I was in denial about it. I went from having loads of friends to having none. \n\nWhen I started secondary school the girl‚Äôs in my school started to say that I was lying and I was looking for attention. I went from being outgoing to never speaking unless it was in class when I would put my hand up. My grades in school really suffered because I was out so much because I was constantly in pain. I got into my dream college course but sadly I had to drop out with only one year left because the spasms and twitching were so bad. Now I work an office job I hate. This is not how my life was supposed to go. \n\nI‚Äôve been in and out of therapy since I was diagnosed. I‚Äôm now 26. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how much of a strain it put on my parents and my brother. I can‚Äôt imagine what it was like for them to hear me crying myself to sleep at night because of the amount of pain.

Each dystonia case can be very different in presentation. However, I want to expand on their comments...\n\nIf you are in the US, you can't just ""go see"" a Movement Disorder Specialist (MDS) as easily as they've made it sound. It is a specialty branch of neurology. Essentially, a specialist of a specialty. There aren't a ton of them. The waiting list is long. They wont even consider scheduling an appointment with you until they have all your medical records. It sucks and it takes awhile.\n\nIf you think you may have dystonia you'll have to start somewhere else first. Orthopedic or a regular neurologist -- be careful to find out their specialty first. I was sent to two different neuros, but one specialized in migraines and the other MS. They had no clue what was going on. One of them actually worked in the same office as an MDS and still had no idea what was happening to me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mention your concerns upfront. Do not be surprised if they haven't heard of this condition. Wherever you start they likely will order scans. Be aware, these can not show dystonia but they can rule out other issues. An x-ray showed my head pulled to the left and helped me to get on the right path, but it's never definitive. Ask for a referral to a MDS specifically. Do some research on who you'd like to see.

hrhs89a,rx46lw,"As others said, getting a dx is one of the hardest things and you've made it!\n\nThe journey to a better day to day is through a LOT of trial and error. As you said, it can be very debilitating. Here's my routine:\n\n- Tramadol 2x/day. One first thing in the morning, for me that's 5-6am. It's very important to stay ahead of the pain. I occasionally misjudge with my second dose in the early afternoon. Thinking my pain is at a manageable level and bam! suddenly it's not. I take 500-1000 mg of tylenol around 9-10am depending on how I'm feeling. Don't discount ibuprofen. It can help with swelling which reduces the pain. Take frequent lay down breaks.\n\n- If I'm going to run errands, I put on three lidocaine patches and take tylenol or ibuprofen beforehand. For me, the patches never help on their own, but coupled or a trifecta they are very beneficial. \n\n- I frequently overdo which will either make the pain worse the next day or leave me bedridden for a few days. Learning *what* is the worth overdoing takes trial and error. I've always been a do-er, so this is the most difficult thing for me mentally. \n\n- Speaking of mental struggles, you will have cycles of grief. I'll think I've accepted my new life, the limitations, then something will happen and I'm plunged into the grief again. This is normal and a very common thing for folks with chronic pain. I find allowing myself to grieve helps me get through it faster than trying to pretend I'm okay, but I do set a 3 day window before I start pushing myself again.\n\n- I'm a huge supporter of therapy. I think it's uber important for anyone with chronic pain to have an outlet for their struggles. Sometimes we want to hide from our loved ones how much we are struggling or have family that aren't supportive. Therapy fills an important role in either case.\n\n- If you haven't yet, see a pain management specialist. They will help you med wise more than the MDS can. \n\n- Keep in mind, Botox is a trial and error process too. Placement and dosage. Injections can (usually) cause a flare that can last up to two weeks, and take up to a month to reach full potential. For some, botox never works. \n\n- Google Tom Seaman. \n\n- FB has a CD support group sponsored by the DMRF, and it's a life saver. Lots of information and support.\n\n- Biggest thing for me is to take one day at a time and listening to your body. If today is a bad day, that's okay. If I have to spend 70% of my day in bed today, that's okay. I'll have hope tomorrow will be better. If today is good, I'll enjoy every moment. I try to celebrate tiny wins. I ran errands *and* washed my hair -- that's a win. Sometimes it's like: bad day and I was able to cook dinner for my family. Evenings are always the hardest for me. Anything that I'm able to do at that time will be considered a win.\n\nWishing you luck and good days!!!",1641478937,t3_rx46lw,/r/Dystonia/comments/rx46lw/hi_i_am_newly_diagnosed_with_cervical_dystonia/hrhs89a/

hqwwp30,rtzums,I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. I suffer from a type of blepharospasm (blepharoclonus) that was caused by an adverse reaction to a drug given to me for nausea. Unfortunately it was permanent for me (happened over four years ago). I see a movement disorder specialist (a type of neurologist) and get Botox on my eyes through her every three months. I did that for the first few years and it helped TREMENDOUSLY. So much so that I go much less often just for ‚Äúmaintenance.‚Äù I also recommend tricks to do at night to help you sleep - it‚Äôs basically ways to distract your brain from the tremors so you can sleep. I sleep with very tight sleep goggles and the feeling of that distracts my brain from my tremors and allows me to sleep. I also used to wear metal eyelid weights every night that you stick on to the outside of the lid. It gets better and easier and yours may go away! Just need to be patient because it can take awhile. The Botox helped a lot but don‚Äôt wait too long to start it (if a doc agrees). Try to see a movement disorder specialist asap. Hope this helps. Oh I also did accupuncture which I actually think helped a little.,1641111697,t3_rtzums,/r/Dystonia/comments/rtzums/blepharospasm_post_moderna_vaccine/hqwwp30/
hshvsfl,rtzums,"I know this is super late, but I just wanted to let you know that I had the exact same thing happen to me. Exactly 2 weeks after my Moderna shot I suddenly developed extremely noticeable blepharospasm. I haven't got any doctor to acknowledge that it even could be from the vaccine (they just say it's stress), but I personally really don't think it's a coincidence. Your body is supposed to have developed antibodies from the vaccine after 2 weeks so I believe that could be related to why my symptoms showed up suddenly at 2 weeks post shot. Maybe for you too? Anyway, I'm really sorry this happened to you too and I hope we both improve!

hqzhfo0,rtzums,Blepharoclonus is incredibly rare. I couldn‚Äôt really find much either. Yes my symptoms have gotten better. I am able to close my eyes now all the way and there is still fluttering but the goggles help me sleep. I‚Äôve also gotten used to it and it‚Äôs just normal to me now. It took about a year for that to happen. I don‚Äôt know if it got less extreme naturally over time or if it‚Äôs due to the Botox. I did the Botox religiously every three months for the first 3 years. Any benefit you‚Äôd get from it would be within the first couple years of onset of symptoms so I really recommend talking to a neurologist again about that and not wasting time with starting it if you choose to go that route.,1641158605,t3_rtzums,/r/Dystonia/comments/rtzums/blepharospasm_post_moderna_vaccine/hqzhfo0/

hqg9efx,rpai1g,"Even more interesting, both of his patients were misdiagnosed with Charcot Marie Tooth at an early age. What are the odds? \n\nYes I have daytime symptoms, as I also was diagnosed with both generalized and focal (hands). I'm a *triple* special snowflake. Triggers are cold, imbalanced foot/leg positioning, dehydration, excessive physical exertion. I lead a very physically active life so it's a constant ""checks and balances"" approach that at this point is background and automatic for me. The one constant is the reaction from folks who assume I'm physically capable of most anything, and they just can't process when I frankly state ""Nope, can't do that."" (eg, get into a kayak, turn a tight bolt, sit on the floor, climb a ladder, etc ad infinitum). People are weird.\n\nThe one thing I do not have is cervical dystonia. Yay? My primary issue is with legs/feet bilaterally, and my earliest memory of an episode is age 9. \n\nAbout 18 months ago I was prescribed Primidone for what was presumed to be essential tremor in my hands. The first nighttime dose of 25mg knocked me on my ass, AND gave me the first night in decades without any dystonia. Hrmmmm. I was unable to continue the Primidone (per ass knocking), but shortly after that I was prescribed Gabapentin 100mg for an unrelated nerve issue, and once again, immediate relief from nocturnal dystonia. I am ridiculously sensitive to medications, and the low 100mg nightly dose of Gabapentin has reduced my episodes by about 90-95%. Anything higher than 100mg and the side effects aren't conducive to quality of life. I have also been taking 20mg Baclofen for several years, originally prescribed for what was misdiagnosed in '08 as Multiple Sclerosis after what I now understand was a series of dystonic storms. What a hayride.\n\nI had an unexpected emergency surgery this past summer, and experienced a whopper dystonic storm beginning on the ride in the red bus and continuing for several hours in the ER until knocked out for surgery. That was awful and scary and painful and really screwed with their ability to examine/diagnosis/treat my injuries, but it was also immediately recognized and managed by the most awesome attending ER doc. This is when I was first given Diazepam, and it was very effective, and my neuro has prescribed that as an ""emergency"" med for when things go wonky. Which they did again recently when I had a dental procedure. So I now know that physically invasive procedures/trauma kick it into the highest gear, which after all these years is a new development, but I am prepared to offset it with Diazepam 2.5mg. \n\nShort story is, after a near lifetime of putting up with this krap and being mostly brushed off/dismissed by doctors predisposed to eyeball rolling, I somehow stumbled into the care of an amazing neurologist who knew something wasn't right, and also knew it wasn't CMT, and it wasn't MS, and it wasn't neuropathy or or or, and relentlessly and ferociously pursued a correct diagnosis in concert with several other amazing neuro/movement/sleep specialists.

hq0wxdh,rkql9c,"I have been exactly where you are right now.. my dystonia started around 7 grade and boy oh boy was I in for the most anxiety ridden roller coaster of my life (little did I know).. I have myoclonic dystonia (dyt11) and I've had some of the best years along with some of the zeeworst.  My hand would shake so bad. I sit up at night till like 4 am trying every possible way to hold a pen or pencil, writing on hard vs smooth thick surfaces (like a few papers stacked), standing and sitting... I would tire my body so bad and be in tears or on the verge that I would be able to write just goof enough and then could go to sleep thinking I could write, only to be embarrassed.  I never could focus on my school work or my surroundings, it just felt like the world spinning around me.  I tried left handed my senior year of high school, it worked for about 2 weeks, but it was the best two weeks I'd ever had in school up to that point..  not long after I did it again after my son was born, same thing happened, it took longer though but it did happen.  Another thing that started was my torso starting to twitch when I wrote and my neck.. keep in mind, I had become a firefighter/emt all on my own, I was a full time firefighter with certifications and a resume that would retire a copying machines work life.  It was horrible, I knew I felt it, I heard a voice in my head say ""your done"" as those feelings where sweeping over me.. and I was .  I was reading a article by the (DMRF) DYSTONIA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION about dystonia and how early onset like mine is somewhat mild to moderate then around 24-28 it blows up and goes beast mode basically, and that it did.  I was 26..  So, underneath all those times of hands sweating you could soak a paper towel, you could hear your heartbeat in your ears, anxiety so bad you feel faint, body aches so bad and digestive issues you feel your dying, and depression so bad you care nothing about anything or anyone and irratible as hell.... yes there is hope..  lol I promise.    First off, realize that there may be things in life you can't do (like write and put thoughts and problems to paper to visualize, organize, and solve).. nope can't do that, but you can like I did take that negative energy and put it towards what you can do and make it a passion to learn every inkling about that activity, concept, process or goal you can.. I never failed a fire service test or physical activity I attempted and found myself more technical than my peers or supervisors.  I also operated heavy equipment since 10 yrs old with my father, I did everything and dreamed about being as smooth and fast as he was, and I was.   That's one good thing that comes out of this situation.  Treatments are tough to attempt I feel because you just want it to stop and go away immediately, doesn't happen.   I've tried every oral medication,  botox and nothing worked..  so, another thing you can do to your advantage is communicate.  Don't be embarrassed or ashamed, you were dealt a less desirable hand of cards than everyone else.  You will be less stressed if the people in your life know, you will feel 10 times the relief..  \nThe only way I was able to make it literally all cease to exist (not totally but comparatively. I can write like I've always dreamed and actively pursuing my passion of the fire service again. A few twitches here or there, way less in intensity and range of motion) was research for a clinical trial on DBS deep brain stimulation..  it was the scariest thing I ever went thru but best and awesome process and road to joy, peace and life....\n\nIf I can ever be there for you or anyone else please message me and we can go from there.

hqb0i9i,ri595i,The first few days on Clono made me so sleepy! Months after I still get a little sleepy like I could take a nap. What dosage are you taking and how many times a day? \n\nClono are Xanax are the same but with Xanax you get a quick release - I used to take 0.25mg for falling asleep too. Clono is slower release but with me I noticed that it starts kicking in after an hour followed by steady release for at least 6-7 hrs. \n\nIs it possible that something in lunesta and trazadone is interacting with it? I would think mixing these would make you pass out and might not even be recommended to take together. Definitely talk to your doctor about this cocktail.\n\nHave you tried something more natural like chamomile tea before bed?

ho7rjmd,refxh5,"I have Dopamine Responsive Dystonia. So, it turns out that estrogen and dopamine are directly proportional to one another. This is why women have PMS. During your period, your estrogen levels are at their lowest for the month; which means you have much less dopamine as well. For me, it means my dystonia symptoms worsen during my period. It also means that I feel at my best during ovulation when my estrogen levels are at their highest. You might have a similar problem, I'm not sure if this correlates with other forms of dystonia but it might be worth looking into. You might just have to amp up your dystonia treatment methods during that time of the month. I usually take anti-inflammatories and sleep a lot more during that time. Sometimes I'll also take an extra dose of carbilev. With DRD at least people are usually more functional after sleep.

hobdq6o,refxh5,"Thank you! I've been trying to change my neuro because I realized I'm in the same situation you were in. My movement disorder doctor at the MIND Clinic (Farmington Hills - I have family in Southfield) went on at my last visit about how much better I'm doing now than when I first saw him 8 years ago. Yes, I get around without the wheelchair I was using 8 years ago but my mobility is still about 50% of what it was 2 years ago. Constant falls aren't good for my knees or other body parts either. \n\nI had to wait until I got my new insurance card because United HMO won't cover anything without a referral from primary care. Fortunately I'm switching to Humana PPO in a couple of weeks, which should help.\n\nGood to know about the Henry Ford MD Clinic as I recently had someone urge me to go there, telling me how wonderful they've been for him. It was odd to have somebody I'd only texted with once rave about the DBS at Henry Ford and how great his neuro is there. I checked and she doesn't even do DBS! Which is likely my next step as botox and its variants have stopped working. \n\nMayo Clinic is my next plan as there's nobody reputable in the area of mid Michigan I'm in. Is there someone you recommend at the Mayo Clinic? \n\nAgreed about clonazepam being a lifesaver - I tried to taper off it years ago, big mistake. It helps with more than the dystonia, as I painfully discovered. \n\nI'll work on PT (and likely OT as well for my hand) after I get treatment other than botox. I wouldn't object to trying a new medication, but I know what I've been on in the past and wouldn't start something new without researching it and conferring with people who have dystonia and have likely tried it. The ""Here, try this great drug, it only has 47 possible side effects, two of which could kill you"" has never been a favorite approach of mine. \n\n85% improved sounds amazing!

I found a sweet spot in terms of diet, exercise, stretches and mental health that works well for me. But if I deviate from that even a little bit (like eating something processed, not sleeping 7-8 hours, or having additional stress) my dystonia worsens remarkably. I would suggest that you keep a journal (something someone else suggested to me on here a month ago) where you keep track of absolutely everything you do and feel and correlate it with your dystonia.

Which is one of many reasons I'm so proud my niece is being considered for a surgical residency at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nCognitive impairment of any kind is unacceptable as my work is editing and occasionally software testing. Honestly, cognitive impairment shouldn't be an acceptable side effect for any but the very worst conditions.\n\nThat's why I was originally against DBS as they couldn't guarantee no loss of cognitive function. I've since realized that the same is true of most medications and nearly any surgery in or affecting the brain. I'm not a lawyer so the loss of my work would have less of an impact, but I enjoy my intellect as it is, thank you very much. :-) \n\nTravel wouldn't be bad, though I'm surprised to find flights from DTW to MSP nearly twice the price on Delta as on American. A hub thing, I assume. Taking an Uber that long sounds awkward. I think I'd have to have earbuds in and either be listening to an audiobook or pretend to do so. Right there with you about wheelchair assistance on the way back, particularly given how large MSP is. \n\nThe clonazepam still helps after nearly 40 years, even at a reduced dose (3 mg/day rather than the 8 mg I had been taking prior to the taper) and it's kind of my miracle pill. I don't know that it does much for the dystonia, but it does wonders for anxiety and depression I never knew I had because I began taking it at 13/14. \nThe same happened to me - I got down to .25 mg and the psychological effect was tremendous as well as frightening. The effect on the dystonia was there, but not nearly as alarming. Unless something better is found, I'll be on clonazepam for the rest of my days.\n\nI've never heard of SPD being used for hemidystonia such as I have, but I haven't really looked into it because I'd been trying to avoid surgery. I'm sure they'll advise me what my options are as well as the advised course of action at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nI'm so happy for you that you went, did something drastic in getting the surgery and had wonderful results combined with fantastic follow up in getting you to the PT and 100%.

My university provides free counseling services and it really helps me. An outside perspective is always useful :) Also remember to be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can with what you've got.\n\nIf you are able to defer, it would be the best option. It takes time to adapt and learn how to cope. I had to take 2 years off, but I had to relearn how to walk, so that time will depend on your situation. It did a world of good for me. I saw a psychologist and a biokineticist who specialises in neurological disorders and they helped me learn how use my body again and to cope with my new reality. I would also suggest that you talk to your doctor about seeing an occupational therapist because the disease is disabling so it helps to find out what you can do/use to make your life easier.\n\nLastly, toxic people. I don't know if anyone else is like this but I had a lot of people in my life who relied on me for emotional support and just took and took. If you have any chronic illness you have enough energy to survive the day and you don't need unnecessary negativity. It is hard, but you're better off cutting your losses.

Without the Hypnosis, gentle yoga, and not-so-gentle THC intake, I‚Äôd be as much of a recluse as I was throughout childhood.\n\nI‚Äôm 22, but I have a friend whose 65 and has had a few strokes, so his face looks about as fucked up as mine does (due to my spasms).

What they taught me was that, yes I can't always control what my body does and that's ok. I can't do anything about it, this is my life now, but I can control how I react to it and how I adapt to it.

If I talk too much I sound like I've been smoking 3 packs of cigarettes a day for 50 years. It can knock your confidence but I found it useful to be kind to yourself and be honest about your voice with others. I found that people have generally been quite nice about it once I told them. I do hope your neuro can figure out a way to help alleviate things for you. It doesn't sound like you have been diagnosed with dystonia just yet, so fingers crossed it's not dystonia :) If it is, I would recommend seeing a therapist.

Now they changed the settings and I'm always at the border between too much dystonia coming through and the voice not being quite there yet, almost there but mostly out of range.

In the end the pain I was in day-to-day and the complete loss-of-function got so unbearable that getting treatment won out and I went. It took a long time to get to that point though because you're also fighting a mental battle. I was very despondent and had given up for a long time. Maybe you can talk to her about it and try to convince her that the short time she'll feel sick from the car ride will be worth gaining some functionality back with treatment. The pain unfortunately never goes away so you can't bargain with that. In our case the phrase ""no pain, no gain"" is a fact of life. \n\nI do have some solid advise though: she's a mom so I'm sure she has a rolling pin? Also get a tennis ball. From what you've described she sounds similar to me. Let her lie down on the floor and put the tennis ball under her bum. Move it to different spots on the bum and hold it there for 10 seconds to start with. It hurts but it helps relieve the spasms. Put it everywhere it hurts most until it doesn't hurt anymore. It should help loosen things in her lower back. Then use the rolling pin on her thighs. Front, back, sides, just like you would use a foam roller. If she gets some relief from that she might be willing to go in the car. *this is very painful but we just have to grit our teeth. Pain now, relief later*\n\nI should mention that I am very lucky to have dopa-responsive dystonia so I have seen great improvement with medication and physical therapy. Her situation might be quite different to mine. It's a difficult situation. Just keep being there for her.

When you're that sick, you need some help to do things and to get out of your own head. Being alone or with someone unsupportive doesn't help at all. Especially with the latter. When you have dystonia you don't have the capacity to deal with takers because you don't have enough energy for yourself as is. So, her environment is very important. I hope she will feel better with the tennis balls. It really works well for me. Oh do tell her not to do it more than twice a week.

hlfbmql,qxm9cb,"She doesn't have a great support system and it sucks. \n\nWe moved away in 2012 for my job. She came to visit me there about eight months later and had lost about 30 lbs. I thought she had cancer and was going to die--the only weight loss I had seen like that was with cancer. She refused to go to the doctor and said she was fine. I'm not sure if motion was hurting her at this time or not, but it took us two years to convince her to see a doctor, and then a neurologist. He diagnosed her with cervical dystonia and recommended botox; tried that and it made her worse (she has tried again since then and it also made her worse). \n\nShe and my dad had a 1950s-ish relationship (he worked, she took care of us at home). He was/is a great provider but is a bad caregiver, if that makes sense. It took a long time for him to understand she physically couldn't take care of him and do house stuff (laundry, cooking, etc). It made him very resentful. The flip side of that is she hid her symptoms and still says she's ok. He is much better now, but she still hides things. She fell in the bathroom a few days ago before bed, but it made a sound like she dropped something in the shower. He asked if she was ok, she said yes, she dropped shampoo. The next morning he walked in the bathroom and noticed the rug was in a weird place. He went to talk to her about it and she had a HUGE rug burn on her and a bruise. We don't understand why she does that, and I wish she would just say ""Because I didn't want you to worry"" or something.\n\nBack to the support system. We are still out of state. My sister lives two hours away but visits rarely. She's super selfish.""m the daughter who is more involved. I was visiting 2-3 times a year until the pandemic, and haven't been home since it started due to an immunocompromised husband. We talk on the phone three times a week, but she asked me not to video call her. I've tried to manage what I can from here--making sure they have insurance, making doctor appointments, meal services, etc. She says no to everything I suggest--physical therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, a Mayo clinic appointment with doctors involved in research. The saying no has been going on the whole time. The few times she did agree to something (Mayo appointment), she had my dad cancel the appointment after she got in because she was ""getting well"". She also won't accept outside help, like someone to clean the house or help her with her day to day needs. I did help her get her medical marijuana card and she will make trips to that doctor for the required check up. She smokes a lot of pot and uses edibles according to my dad. I guess it helps?? But I don't know how easy it is to distinguish between how the med are helping and pot is helping, and if an increase or decrease in one or the other might be better for her.\n\nHer childhood friends dropped her years ago and I have no idea why. She says it's because she's Republican and shared her thoughts on Facebook, and they're Democrats so they don't like her anymore. She is very easily offended and holds grudges--she wasn't like that in the before times. I'm pretty sure there had to be some fights over FB Messenger about something not political. One of her meds made her very combative (pain probably didn't help) around that time. She also hid her diagnosis from them for a long time. My parents moved to a tiny town with no health care options when they retired, and had just started building a community there when she was diagnosed. Those people fell away because she stopped leaving the house to do things. \n\nIt's a very difficult situation all around. Like I said before, we don't know what to do except for keep her as comfortable as she will let us. More than you asked for, but just typing it out really helped.

hl3wi12,qwb78s,"Hi! I can tell you what I do with mine, maybe it'll help.\n\nFirst of all, I never let it discharge under 50%. From around 50% to 100% it takes about a couple of hours or less to recharge, so that's manageable for me. Sometimes it happens that I forget about it and stay more days without recharging (I remeber once I let it discharge completely and that's bad, Medtronic says).\n\nOf course the whole thing depends on your stimulation  parameters. In my specific case, my battery drops from 100% to 50% in around 5 days, so let's say that I recharge it on monday, then the next time I'll have to do it will be friday/saturday. Recharging every 5 days doesn't bother me at all.\n\nSome years back I used to recharge the battery at night, while sleeping. I didn't put on the whole ""harness"" since it's too uncomfortable for me. I just put the inductive magnet on my pacemaker and then went to sleep (laying upwards). Nowadays I can only fall asleep on my side, so I can't do this anymore. However I always find some time during my day to lay down and recharge the battery.\n\nKeep in mind that if you don't have whole hours to spend for this thing, you can just do it daily for, let's say, half an hour when you watch your TV in the evening (or stuff like that).\n\nMoreover, if the whole harness doesn't bother you that much, you can put it on when you're home and still do your tasks, without the need of being at rest. Since, while moving, the magnet moves around it doesn't always emit much power so the recharge time will be longer (that's why I prefer to recharge while laying down, because the signal is always strong and I minimize the recharge time).\n\nIn my opinion, this rechargeable battery made my life 1000% better than before. With ""disposable"" pacemakers I reached a point where I had to replace them each year basically and that meant undergo surgery that often, which is unsustainable for me.",1637234263,t3_qwb78s,/r/Dystonia/comments/qwb78s/deleted_by_user/hl3wi12/

Don't make excuses, your body really is not listening to you, that's a key characteristic of dystonia.  \n\n\n>My question is does your Dystonia get worse when you are tired?\n\nDystonia gets worse when you are stressed. When you are exhausted, it can get worse. 20 years ago doctors thought that fatiguing the muscles would alleviate symptoms, but really it just aggravates them. I'm not a woman, but I imagine when you're on your cycle, you feel more stress or pain that's related solely to your cycle - so this will make your dystonia symptoms worse.  \n\n\nThere's also a book I think you (& other dystonia patients) should read, called ""The Body Keeps The Score"".

hjibtd2,qnr2y8,"Honestly? I don't want to get DBS unless I'm in my 30s and everything else is off the table. I have a long history of depression, and I have been told that DBS isn't recommended for people who have had thoughts of ending their own lives. I had an inpatient psych hospital stay a year ago, followed by 8 weeks of outpatient therapy. My mental health is way, way better now, but it took everything in me to keep going and I am protective over all of that progress. I was set to go to Mayo after the psych stay, but chickened out once my neurologist here (TX, has been with me for over 2 years) said she really would not recommend it due to knowing me for so long and knowing how bad my mental state got (for a variety of reasons, dystonia being one of many). She said she was concerned that doing it at 24-26 could lead to a miserable 50+ years. \n\nBoth Mayo and UT Southwestern here in Texas said DBS would be heavily considered due to the amount of medication failures, but I don't want to start entertaining that idea until there is literally nothing left to try. If it came down to daily benzos & constant dosage updates, I'd probably go with that over the surgery. \n\nOn an emotional & mental level, dystonia ruins enough things in life. I attached a lot of my self-esteem as a teenager to having a disability that I got bullied for and had to really work hard to accept. I (as of right now, in my mid-twenties) don't want to do something like DBS and have a constant reminder by seeing the pack in my chest, dealing with battery replacements, and having the scars. I'm not at a point where I can handle that yet, as dumb as it may sound. I've lost a lot of people, and an engagement to a childhood friend, from the unknowns of it. It scares people, which hurts even though I know the right people won't peace out when things get hard. Since I CAN write left handed at the moment, slow & messy or not, I'd probably just give in and no longer try with the right hand.

My wife's neuro-ophthalmologist recommended that we seek out alternative treatment as the onset of her Blephorspasms were so severe that Botox would not have been a long term option. We treat our dystonia with an oral splint from the author of the book I recommended. My condition is more severe, requiring a $15k Evo Q27 cold laser, turmeric/golden paste, cannabis salves and constant stretching throughout the day. Our treatment is not conspiracy theory. It is effective, less invasive and considerably less expensive than the ""Standard of Care"" Botox, nerve blocks, etc., with NO pharmaceuticals. \n\nTo hammer the point, this is not conspiracy theory, it is documented medical fact. Many cases of MS, Parkinson's and dystonia are TMJ related due to improper jaw alignment causing pressure on the Trigeminal nerve which sends distorted information through the Basal Ganglia. My Chiropractor, prior physical therapists, docs at Stanford & Sierra Pacific Orthopedics recognize this. All of my wife's dentists from her 22 year tormented TMJ journey have awakend.

I actually had my shots again today and she upped it to 300 units, which is the most we have tried. Maybe it will last longer and maybe it won't. \n\nI also have been doing physical therapy with a specialist that treats patients with dystonia. It includes some strengthening excises and a massage afterwards. It:s a very light massage because that works for me. For me it's all about calming my nervous system down. I usually take a nap after i get home lol which is nice. \n\nLastly, and thanks to Shakey and this group of fantastic people on here, I got on Clonozepam. I was popping Xanax, min dose twice a day and noticed it helped but it didn't last long before the tension and pain came back. Clonozepam is way better for cervical dystonia.

hgbx0yy,q6h2lu,"Hi guys! I‚Äôm new here and I would just like to share some of my experiences with you. I was in high school when I first had the symptoms of Dystonia. I was writing with my dominant hand and my elbow up in the air. My classmates used to make fun of my writing posture and I was not aware of what was happening to me. I just felt weird because I do not write that way at all up until that day. When I was in my senior year of high school, I got diagnosed by a neurologist. He said that I had Dystonia. He recommended me having botox injections which at the time, we could not afford. So I had to deal with College having Dystonia. It was grueling experience but I somehow managed to graduate even with this disability. Now I am almost 26, and I havent done anything for my Dystonia because I am afraid and anxious. Texting has been a painful experience and typing and holding a mouse has been extremely difficult lately. I refuse to take any more medication. I‚Äôve tried Artane and didn‚Äôt work.

The good thing about Botox when you are uncertain about its effects is that it does wear off. So if you have the Botox and you‚Äôre not happy with it, the neurologist can try a different pattern next time, or you might decide to stop the treatment. But you kind of have nothing to lose by trying it (except for the financial cost, and a couple of months of either brilliant relief from symptoms, or no relief, or some relief).

hev7n9i,pyf4hn,"Hi, I also have DRD and I'm also in a career (lawyer) that requires a lot of cognitive skills, careful thought, attention to detail, etc. I have had periods of time where I've had issues with short term memory, focus, zoning out and other things you describe. For me one of the causes has been medication changes, if I've increased by L-Dopa dose I can be foggy for a few weeks as my body adjusts. It always does settle though. If you're taking anything other than carbilev, some other medications, many muscle relaxants for example, can cause those symptoms.\n\nAnother thing to remember is having DRD can be exhausting for the body and for the mind. Relearning how to walk is exhausting, physio in general is exhausting (it's good you're doing it though) and just existing with DRD can be exhausting sometimes with the amount of strain it puts your body under. That amount of fatigue, I find, can bring on cognitive symptoms. But they have not been permanent. It sounds like you've gone through a lot but you're doing all the right things to manage the DRD and as your body adjusts the cognitive symptoms should go down.\n\nStress can also add to this. Find things that reduce your stress level and give yourself permission to do them as much as you need. Gentle yoga, funny TV, sitting in nature... you'll know best what works for you.\n\nIt might be worth talking to your doctor about getting a sleep study and make sure you're actually getting quality sleep. If you're not that can also affect your cognitive abilities. If you can, try adding an extra hour of sleep to your night, you might need more rest. Also consider getting some bloodwork done to check if you're low on any nutrient which can affect cognitive skills.\n\nI know this is easier said than done, but try not to worry too much about what the future will look like, what this all means for your career and whether things are getting worse. It's a vicious cycle, it increases stress which can increase the symptoms. I found journaling can be helpful for dealing with the worry. Try to tell yourself that this is temporary and these symptoms will improve. It doesn't feel like it when you're in the midst of it but it does. I had a lot of cognitive symptoms after a flare up last year, and with COVID disrupting all the helpful stuff in my routine, and was worried I didn't have what it takes to do my job anymore, and then one day I noticed myself picking up on details that other people hadn't and forming more creative arguments and strategies and remembering things better. Your cognitive skills are still there, you don't just lose them. DRD is not an illness that robs those and a good number of people with DRD have Masters degrees and work in professions that require a lot of cognitive ability.\n\nSorry for the giant wall of text. I hope things start improving for you soon. Microbiology sounds really interesting!",1633018947,t3_pyf4hn,/r/Dystonia/comments/pyf4hn/some_cognitive_issues/hev7n9i/

I need exercise to wear myself out, and that helps me get a better night's sleep. For years I tried to get by on three hours of sleep. Memory was shot.  With my exercise, sleep hygiene, and edible gummies I do manage to get a decent night's sleep which helps everything.\n\nI'm still working as an Electronics Engineer.

Still, the twitching twisting, mouth contortions, and jaw popping was so minimal I could‚Äôve cried. \nI feel that the medication lasted for roughly 6 hours, before I started to feel the symptoms returning. The first thing I noticed was the jaw movements, followed by the return of tension in the shoulder and neck region. I waited until 8:15 PM to take the next dose.

He has a number of patient experience videos (again, they frustratingly only unlock a week at a time), and the ""before"" videos of the cervical dystonia patients look just like me. If I can increase my chances of getting to the ""after"" bit by following the program, that's worth it.\n\n2. So this is bonkers, but I had jaw surgery in 2015, way before dystonia. The surgeon mentioned that there was a chance that I would have permanent numbness in my chin, and I fell into that camp. Further, the surgeon said that if feeling wasn't back within a year, it never would be. While I've been doing Farias's program, which includes some remapping exercises, I've regained feeling in the jaw.

Anxiety and stress makes dystonia so much worse. I too, have developed panic disorder in 2014. I never even knew about anxiety or panic disorder existing before it hit me upside the head out of nowhere and unprovoked. My cervical dystonia started to slowly creep in and the pain was becoming unbearable. I went to various doctors, had scans done, tried physical therapy at a sports clinic, even tried acupuncture out of desperation. Fast forward to 2019 and I finally got the right diagnosis and treatment that is still a work in progress...\n\nI get Botox shots every three months but unfortunately they only last 4-5 weeks for me. I know some people get the full 3 months of relief. It all depends on a person. I also do physical therapy but at a hospital rehab center that understands and treats people with dystonia. I do some strengthening exercises for my neck muscles and a gentle massage afterwards. The massage calms my nervous system down, which is what seems to work for me. I also have been on Celexa SSRI since 2014 which works for the panic disorder but not so much for my cervical dystonia. Thanks to the great peeps on here, I recently started to take Clonozepam and I have to say, it has been helping me a lot!

Most neurologists are not likely to have opinions about these issues‚Äîmaybe the neurosurgeon has seen some examples, but our experience is that the Botox specialists are unlikely to weigh in on neurosurgeons‚Äô territory and vice versa, although we go to a very well-known university medical center and there are boundaries that they don‚Äôt cross.  \n\nExample: we have been seeing the same neurology team for Botox for over a decade. He has had spinal issues for well over 20 years, totally unrelated to dystonia. When he started having falls at home, we were finally put in touch with a neurosurgeon, who scheduled spinal surgery this fall. We wish we had been sent to this line 10 years ago, but at that time, we didn‚Äôt expect him to live this long. Our family doctor told us to expect him to live until at least 90, and that sounds impossible until it doesn‚Äôt. We find ourselves sitting in the house way too much, which has been aggravated by the pandemic. So now it looks like the balance and stability issues caused by his spinal issue will likely be under control‚Äîjust as the Botox has done its damage to his wrist and neck muscles. We‚Äôre just thankful for modern medicine, Medicare, and health insurance.\n\nThat said, I wish your dad a speedy recovery, and all the best to you. Our bodies deserve the best treatment we can give them, but we do not have control over the results. Family support is a blessing for both sides. Cherish each other.

hc644i6,pg26gn,"Down with Dystonia has been a 501(c)3 organization since 2015. We are the new kids on the block and based in California. The primary mission of DWD is to raise awareness about dystonia, the third largest movement disorder behind ALS and Parkinson's Disease.\n\nThe DMRF is wonderful at research and we will help them find a cure in due time. For now, our main concern is serving those who are lost and hopeless find the treatment they need today to live a purposeful life.  \n  \nThe organization's founder has lived with dystonia for over 25 years. His journey has led to prescriptions for a plethora of pharmaceutical drugs, genetic testing, visits to several university hospitals, major success with deep brain stimulation, many setbacks, excellent response to the use of botulinum toxin injections and excellent relationships with leading doctors on the west coast.  \n  \nThere are many types of dystonia that affect each individual differently. There is not one answer that is suitable for all people. A multi-faceted approach to wellness is key.  \n  \nInformation about financial metrics can be found on the Form 990 on the IRS website. Our efforts to be successful have been negatively affected for the last year and a half by Covid-19. We did not qualify for relief funds since the Executives takes no pay. We are on track for a big 2022 and look forward to helping many.  \n  \nThat being said, we are seeking to increase our financial support to fund the following campaigns: enhance our website, creating training programs and to increase our social media presence through a series highlighting people who live with dystonia so others may learn from their experiences. We have a viral campaign about to launch too. These are just a few efforts in the works.\n\nOur campaigns will spread awareness, educate, and allow more access to medical treatments to those with dystonia. In the future, we wish to fund treatment directly to those afflicted by dystonia, burdened with travel expenses and loss of wages.  \n  \nLet us know if you have any more questions and we'll get back to as soon as possible. We're knee deep in Dystonia Awareness Month, putting final details on the rest of 2021 and gearing up for 2022. Please share any of information with your friends and family.

ha3xw5c,pa9xp7,"Sorry for the incoming novel.\n\nYour symptoms sound just like mine! Especially the way you describe pain. Having to be upright all day feels like I've been trying to beat the world record for heaviest weight lifted, off the back of my head and shoulders. Just existing leaves me in pain. My symptoms have spread down my back and now I have that same pain all the way down into the sides of my waist. Constant, tonic spasms like Shakey described. Spasms doesn't seem the right word when it's constant like that. Awful pain levels.\n\nLidoderm patches (lidocaine) help me when I know I have to do something that will trigger my muscles, though it's not great at sticking around the shoulders/neck and you can't put it where hair keeps it from keeping contact with the skin(head hair). Helps a lot if I have to walk a lot.\n\nI get tramadol for the pain(150-200mg 3 to 4 pills daily, usually take 3 or 3.5), I'm also maxed out on baclofen for my weight (80 mg) and I take Xanax, 1mg total in a day, spread it out like you do. Like a lot of other dystonia sufferers, I also had a significant anxiety disorder, which is how I got the benzos in the first place. I used to be on a fair bit more but my drs didn't like that I was on higher doses despite the fact that it helped me more. I wanted to switch to Clonazepam, as it's longer acting. But they just don't want me to rock the boat.\n\n I've been on different kinds of opioids for almost a decade without issue or abuse. But they don't really care how good of a patient I am. It can be hard to find a doctor that empathizes or listens and recognizes chronic pain from an incurable condition requires some kind of pain management. Most shut down at the mention of opioids so sometimes doctor shopping is necessary but I hate that phrase and hate that I have to do that. I only take them so I can function at all, even just getting out of bed. \n\n\nPhysical therapy and massage actively makes my muscle spasms and pain infinitely worse. Like poking a bear.\n\n\nI've been getting Botox for about a decade, switched to xeomin(same as Botox just different brand basically) march 2020. But then the pandemic shut down my drs office for in office visits and I'm still waiting to start injections again. Botox was never very helpful, only a little but I won't say no to it.\n\n\n\n In the interim, I discovered swimming helps me with pain and fatigue a bit. I live near a military base, my husband recently retired so I have access to the base facilities including the pool. I swim 30 laps every other day and actually have energy afterwards to do stuff! When I take my dog on a m walk I *have to* lay down after because it triggers my muscles. The low impact exercise has helped more than anything else so far.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to get the selective peripheral denervation, which I learned about from Shakey! I'm avoiding it for now bc of the pandemic and some other personal reasons. I hope I can be like Shakey and be at 90% functionality, pain free. \n\nI've heard deep brain stimulation helps some people but I won't go anywhere near that. Too many unknowns.",1629769246,t3_pa9xp7,/r/Dystonia/comments/pa9xp7/how_to_deal_with_the_pain/ha3xw5c/

I've been doing Joaquin Farias's program at dystoniarecoveryprogram.com, and while I have a long way to go to be symptom free, here's where I think it helps with the pain:\n\n If you look into [vagus nerve stimulation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/vagus-nerve-stimulation/about/pac-20384565), there is an implanted device that is approved for epilepsy and depression, and a non-invasive device in Europe used for epilepsy, depression, and pain.  Some several-year-old studies show that this treatment shows potential benefits in [dystonia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256665402_Expected_Effects_of_Auricular_Vagus_Nerve_Stimulation_in_Dystonia) as well.\n\nOne big part of the Farias method is using different techniques to stimulate the vagus nerve- diaphragmatic breathing, breathing like you're yawning to tickle the uvula, etc. Like I said, pain hasn't been an issue for me so far, so it may be worth trying.

hi93eze,p6xbct,Dry needling helped me more than acupuncture. Primidone (anti seizure medicine) has helped me more than most other drugs but I do feel very forgetful and a little loss of metal acuity.  Clonazepam might‚Äôve helped a little more but seemed to have stronger side effects.  Stretching helps me.  Only my right arm shakes so keeping my shoulders looser reduces my tremor.  Also the body blade PT device helps me.  Walmart.com has a knock off version for $27 called the reactor.  Alcohol helps too honestly but I don‚Äôt want to drink everyday.

Hence why going though a known program to find someone might be the best option, as most programs/clinics do have a list of people who they recommend clients to for addition help or the like. \n\nLike all things out there in the medical filled you might well find someone who gets you and has 0 affiliation to your condition(s) and who might well be the best thing that happened to you for help, you just have to figure out what option(s) will work best for you and what you are looking for help with. \n\nWhy I said personal experience is because I saw a person who labeled me with a world of a lot of crap diagnosis and for all they listened to me, they really didn't. They actually caused me more mental harm then they where actually helping me with, as they didn't understand what was going on AT ALL. I was dealing with a parent with at the time unknown to me or his GP had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's (I suspected he had it, but because of our laws I couldn't push the topic with getting him evaluated, until it was to late to do so) via a mental health program he'd joined (who never shared their info with his GP or with me), all the actions he was doing that was causing me to question myself was hurting me mentally yet the person who I looked to for help said I was attention seeking and a few other things, plus depressed and had high anxiety (yes I was depressed, but not to the level that they listed and nope no anxiety of the nature that they listed on my file - that I later had to have expunged/corrected). \n\nWhen I did learn that my dad had Alzheimer's a weight was lifted from me, all of a sudden ALL the crap I'd been going though made sense and I was able to get him the help he needed (sadly that involved lousing my home and the stable living environment that I had).  Sadly his official on paper diagnosis came to late to save him, by then he had developed cancer and only had just over a year to live (of which I would know nothing of until 3 months before he would pass, because no one knew he had it until it was to late to treat it). \n\nI went back to the person who had diagnosed with me a boat load of stuff to inform them that their diagnosis was bull crap, they said that it wasn't that I was just in denial about what was really going on and was blaming my parent for my issues (yet the therapist though the Alzheimer's society said that I didn't have abc 123 issues and that the person who had diagnosed me with such was full of BS). \n\nThis person from the Society then put me in touch with a person who was recommended by my local dystonia organization who took over from her when the time was right, the new person is really a therapist for those with chronic illnesses (she specializes in long term and orphan conditions that are disabling) and the bonus she is also a T1D so understands that side of things which has been very helpful in talking and figuring things out (aka figure out where what is being effected by X vs by Y condition or combo there of).",1627865710,t3_oul1cl,/r/Dystonia/comments/oul1cl/therapy/h7dk1e8/

Like a lot of the posters here, I don't have much experience with childhood dystonia- I got hit with cervical dystonia this year, but here's what ""recovery"" has meant for me:\n\nI view ""recovery"" as a 4-tiered pyramid of rehab, medication, adaptation, and acceptance.\n\nObviously, if your daughter could rehab all of her symptoms away, that would be ideal. I'm not sure that's possible for everyone, but look into Dr. Farias work at fariastechnique.com. He has a streaming site with exercises at dystoniarecoveryprogram.com for $35 a month. I've been doing the program for about 5 months, and am better than I was before. I know he's done work with children, which you can see an example of by looking up his presentation to Harvard Medical School on youtube.\n\nWhat you can't rehabilitate, it would be ideal if you could medicate. Botox is obviously in this category, as well as the meds others have talked about. In the papers I have read, it seems that children respond differently than adults, with levadopa being more effective. See the paper ""Treatment Strategies for Dystonia""\n\nWhat you can't rehabilitate or medicate, next comes adaptation- These are tools that help manage the symptoms that remain. Depending on the area of spasms, this might be things to help her hold her pencil, one-handed keyboards, etc. These are usually found by trial and error, and asking ""what if"" questions.\n\nFinally, what you can't rehabilitate, medicate, or adapt to has to go in the last bucket of ""acceptance."" Here's the cruel thing about dystonia- it's a positive feedback loop. The dystonia fuels anxiety, and the anxiety fuels the dystonic symptoms, so it's easy to get trapped. Dr. Farias's program helps quite a lot with this part of recovery, as well, with courses to help with relaxation and mindfulness- breathing, meditation, yoga, etc. It's all helpful.\n\nI wish you and your daughter the best!",1627135595,t3_oqhqlw,/r/Dystonia/comments/oqhqlw/daughter_diagnosed/h6d79g8/
h6dbno4,oqhqlw,"I was diagnosed with dystonia when I was five. I remember my teacher took a wagon with us to the playground, so when I got cramps I could sit in the wagon on the way back to class. I also got a 504, so I got extra time on tests (sometimes I did get cramps during my tests, but I also had anxiety, which might be related to my dystonia). I would definitely sit down with the school and ask for all of the accommodations they can give her, and sit down with each of her teachers every year and explain how this is for her. \n\nMy dystonia faded as I aged. I don‚Äôt remember anyone bullying me for it in elementary school. I did eventually develop severe Tourette‚Äôs in high school. And yeah, a few people bullied me for it. But more than anything, I remember my classmates coming around me and supporting me. I remember I was at an Academic Team competition (which is supposed to be silent) and I had really bad tics. My friend sat beside me and they did all of my tics with me so I wouldn‚Äôt feel alone To this day when I tic, people around me just celebrate it and love me for it, support me in it. I really imagine it‚Äôll be the same for your daughter. Some people will be jerks - that says a lot about them (and how they‚Äôve been raised). But I‚Äôve found that more people surrounded me with care, and I very much hope that is the same for your daughter. \n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre doing a great job.

h6dddis,oqhqlw,"if she can be in a support group - even online - with other kids with dystonia, I also think that could help a lot. One of the hardest things for me was that I felt like the only person in the world who experienced this pain in my body, and my parents and family were so supportive, but I still felt lonely. I think knowing any other person with dystonia would have helped me with this. \n\nAnd looking back - I‚Äôm 25 now - I think that I felt very disconnected from my body for decades, because my early experiences with it were so painful and hard. It‚Äôs difficult to not be in control of your own body, to be hurt by it in ways that you and the people around you don‚Äôt understand. So I would recommend trying to find positive experiences with her body. \n\nAnd my dad believed that I shouldn‚Äôt let any disability hold me back. So even when I got cramps every time I went into the pool, I still played in the pool with other kids. I still played sports every year of my childhood. And that was hard (I‚Äôm a bookworm), but I‚Äôm so grateful for it, because I never ever felt limited because of dystonia. It just seemed like a challenge that I was strong enough to overcome, again and again. (In high school I went to a Regional competition for swimming. And I‚Äôve just gotten to do so many things, I‚Äôm so grateful) \n\nI say this because your daughter‚Äôs condition sounded a lot like mine. Looking back at my childhood, I don‚Äôt think that dystonia defined it. It was part of it. Disability has undeniably shaped my life, and continues to shape it. But I still got to be a kid. I had friends. I had good times with my family. I danced and laughed and played and had a ton of fun and joy. I hope very much the same for your daughter - and I really believe that‚Äôll be the case for her. \n\nFinally.. I expect you already know this. But rubbing cramps helps a lot. Cold makes it worse, heating pads make it better. For me, laying down and trying to relax is the absolute best thing. And just being gentle and kind and supportive the whole time, which I know you already are. \n\nShe‚Äôs going to be okay. If she‚Äôs anything like me, she‚Äôs going to be okay.

h5w3j34,oo23gv,"More or less, yes, my experience has been similar. Botox helped the cervical bit, then medicinal marijuana allowed me to begin exercising again after a 15 year break (I was undiagnosed and depressed for a long time). I started with 5 minutes or less of light movement, building up to 10+ hours/day of exercise, physio and walking. Dr. Farias was a huge help in my understanding of this disorder and my ongoing recovery. I've since been able to reduce my exercise/physio/walking to an hour or two per day - with a better understanding of which exercises and stretches are most effective for me. Breathwork has also been helpful and I've learned to use my breath to stretch the abdomen and ribcage from the inside.\n\nIf you're anything like me, you may want to monitor for anxiety. For me, sensing a spasm coming (or moving in a way which I knew might trigger it) would lead me to remember the last one - and worry that this one would be as bad, or worse - which would strengthen the spasm. Now, when I feel this coming, I relax my body and mind and focus on long exhales.\n\nMy experience has led me to be gentle, but consistent. There are no days off, though I do have lighter days now.

I'm not worried about scars if this can offer me real relief.\n\nDid your dystonic muscles go very far past where they did the incision?\n\nI'm bilaterally affected, no obvious head tilt but my chin tucked down ans my shoulders into a rolled forward posture. Muscle tension goes so far down, from my head to my waist, and reduced general flexibility. Wondering where they'll cut. If different patients have different incision locations.\n\nDid they decide where to cut based on EMG readings?\n\n But all around my shoulders and underarms have insane tightness and pain, along with my paraspinals going all the way down my back. I wonder if doing this SPD surgery at the neck stops lower body symptoms or not. Though I wouldn't think so. I just thought I'd be sliced open all the way down my back. Or for pain around my skull/scalp if they would work into that area.\n\nAnother quick random question, did they have to shave any part of your hair?

That made her anxious and eat less, which in turn do not help at all. So what she gained in hand quality of life because of the pill, translated in losing an all-around quality of life. So, she went on with the next pill in line, which in turn made her sleepy, which doesnt help with her work. People differ in their reactions. Some have more manageable sypmtoms. She did not.

I will be asking him why he's so against it. He knows I'm very worried about long term meds and their effects, so I'm sure he has a very good reason. Next time I'll also be inquiring about Klonopin. I'm on Xanax so I don't see why he might say no to that. We'll have to see.

Stress and Dystonia do not mix. \nIf your doctor suspects it, you should have an MRI at the very least. I'm pushing for a brain MRI so we can have a bigger/better picture of my cervical dystonia. I was also prescribed a TENS unit and that has helped during work hours when you can't take pain meds. If you are able to get one, I would suggest you purchase the pads off of Amazon, WAY cheaper than going to any pharmacy or any medical specialty store. The pads can only really be used once for the day. The spray they suggest, I have found to be a waste of money. Make sure you see a specialist for muscular movements and/or neurologist. Physical therapy has helped as well. Getting massages are also very helpful. If you have headaches, make sure they release your occipital muscle? in the back of your neck. Trapezius and neck areas also help me personally quite a bit. \nIf you think of it, I'd like to hear an update on your sinemet experience. \nHave a great weekend!

h66ag5m,ohs5tv,"Well it's good that he's generally open-minded. He's probably not alone in thinking levodopa is a bad idea, but everything I've heard says it's at *least* safe in the short term for most people. So you could get a second opinion if you really want to rule out a dopa-responsive condition, although it may not be worth it if your current treatment work.\n\nI think the main reason my MDS jumped to Sinemet is the general slowness in everything I do, especially on the right side. I don't have overt dystonia symptoms except with complex voluntary movements (e.g., writer's cramp and a ""walking tremor""). It resembles Parkinson's but progressed very quickly and then stabilized (I think), which is common for dopa-responsive dystonia. Tremors don't necessarily indicate a dopa-responsive problem themselves.\n\nI'll post here again when I have some updates.

h4rl7kv,ohs5tv,"Out of curiosity, and if you don‚Äôt mind answering (and you certainly don‚Äôt have to), how do your symptoms present? \n\nMy neuro mentioned possible dystonia after he had me draw spirals with my right hand, then my left. I‚Äôm right hand dominant, but he said my left was clearly much more clumsier.\n\nSo while the symptoms I described in my previous reply started less than a year ago, I should probably also say that I have other symptoms as well, but my neuro doesn‚Äôt believe these are related to dystonia, which was why I didn‚Äôt mention it. One is a really strange one that my neuro said had not seen before. When I put all my weight on my left foot and try to balance on it, I wobble. A lot. I just can‚Äôt stay standing on it without falling over. The other weird thing is, doing this triggers my right foot and leg to shake uncontrollably. And when I balance and place all my weight on my right leg, it‚Äôs a night and day difference. I can balance like normal. This symptom also started around Jan 2021.\n\nAs for the other symptoms, I had a likely focal aura seizure when I was 25 (I‚Äôm 30 now). This seizure triggered a whole set of symptoms from that day forward. Photosensitivity to flashing lights, flashing lights and loud sounds triggering my eyelids to blink uncontrollably and my face to make weird contortions, synesthesia (I can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù flashing lights), excessive daytime sleepiness, zoning out, dyskinesia, and a lot of random body twitching. Most of these symptoms have gotten better over time. He does not believe the possible dystonia could be related but can‚Äôt say for certain.   \n\nAnd yes!

I wasn't given anything else at the time, so there is no explanation for it, as we all know it doesn't kick in right away. \nA week later, I was back in the office (he squeezed me in) with so much pain, I was literally in tears. He put me on a Prednisone taper which helped tremendously. \nFor the first time in 2 years, I am ""functioning"". Doing ""normal stuff"". I took my dog to the beach, it was his first time being exposed to the water and he swam! I've gone on walks. I can do more than one household chore at a time without having to take a break from the pain. We had friends over for a BBQ and I was able to participate for the whole time! I was so excited to be able to do that.\nJuly 4th, we took our boat out for the 1st time in 2 yrs. It's a deck boat (like a pontoon), I was beyond ecstatic that we were able to spend the afternoon/evening on it, without having to cut the time short, to rush home because of my pain. Right now, doing anything that I try to do and not having to stop/cut it short due to pain is absolutely amazing, exciting, and cherished.\nI'm not saying I'm pain free, (as I'm anxiously awaiting for my appt next week to get trigger point injections) but I'm not bed bound. I feel like there might?? be some light at the end of this lonely, excruciating painful, exhausting, depressing, misunderstood tunnel.\nWe all know stress does not help AT ALL...... \nFebruary 15, 2020 (the day after Valentine's day), I lost my mother unexpectedly, heart attack (13 days after she turned 65). April 3, 2021 (the day before Easter), I lost my 38 year old brother, unexpectedly, organ failure. He had just made Captain of Cyber Intelligence/Security in the Air Force one month before he passed, he left behind a wife and 2 boys, ages 6 and 8. \n2¬Ω months later, June 19, 2021 (the day after my youngest brother's birthday/the day before Father's day), I lost my 40 year old brother, drug abuse. One month before he died, he was escorted by ambulance, out of our home because I had to call 911 to save his life, when he decided to shoot up with heroin. He was at our home for 10 days. He had been homeless for over a year and after losing my other brother, we decided we'd give him 2 months to stay with us and get back on his feet. I had no idea, whatsoever, that he was an addict of any sort, until it was too late. We have the same dad, but different moms- I had three ¬Ω brothers, now just one. \nTo top that off, if one really can, I no longer have a job. Just a ""tiny"" bit of stress.....\nWith the passing of my mom, the doctor put me on Prestiq (antidepressant). I'm also on baclofen, zanaflex (both are muscle relaxants and neither of them seem to work- my body is in constant flight or fight mode), gabepentin (as I also have fibromyalgia), Motrin (inflammation), morphine sulfate ER (attempt to keep pain down-lowest dose), Percocet (for break through pain-lowest dose), and because I can't sleep, trazadone, lunesta, and Xanax. With the passing of my brothers so close together, and still trying to cope with my mom's passing, I've been in a tailspin and doctor upped my Prestiq (which is also supposed to help with the CD). The heating pad and Sombra (muscle spasm cream- highly recommended- look it up, it's on Amazon) are my go to's. \nI'm not due for my 3rd round of shots until September. I'm very hopeful that this is the path to ""normalcy"". Will there ever be a pain free day? One can only hope! \nIn the meantime, I'll keep doing physical therapy, massage therapy (thank the heavens above, my daughter is a licensed massage therapist!), counseling, and Botox. I hope to be off pain pills soon. I hope Botox will help most people because as we all know, nothing really works. \nGood bless you all!\nThanks for reading my rant.

But maybe that's all that shows because I use like 2 qtips a day, I don't give my ears a chance to build up wax. But the itch drives me nuts. Such an annoying side effect. \n\nAs for Botox, I've been getting it for 10yrs. Last year I switched to xeomin, same thing, just a different brand. I see my doctor on a military base, so they don't have to stay open to make money. My doctor's office was closed because their building became the covid operation center, so there wasn't any space for them to see any pain patients. \n\nI couldn't go somewhere else for injections because they wouldn't let me split care. When I tried looking for Drs on the civilian side, they treated me like shit for needing pain meds. Military docs didn't. So I decided to buckle down and deal with symptoms as much as I could, depending on meds more for relief, and to wait it out for injections again.\n\nBut they recently opened back up. I was told I'm last to be seen, (which is only 3rd in line)since I'm not an active duty soldier, just a spouse. I am happy it will be sometime soon but I wish I knew when.\n\nGlad to hear Botox works for you!

There's a company called Neuroworx that my company does a lot of fund-raising for. They do neuroplasticity work for spinal cord injuries, etc. I was googling ""Neuroworx dytonia"" to see if they did any work with this, and they didn't, but a page from ""The Brain's Way of Healing"" came up that had him on it. I signed up that day. I'm happy to give more thoughts on the program if you like.  Botox has been a mess for me. I still haven't had my first in-network appointment with a movement disorder specialist- they were 6 months out. I had to pull some strings and pay out of pocket to see an out-of-network guy to do it. I'm not positive what went wrong, but a week after injections, I became hard locked for the first time- I only had spasms before that. I didn't receive any advise about post care, and I suspect that what happened is I massaged the injection site and pushed it out of the muscle, but I'm not sure.

h4d8tkh,ofj7um,"So, let me kind of lay out what the program is, and then why I have reason to believe that it provides some benefit. I'm happy to answer any other questions you might have.\n\nThere's a ton of different content that unlocks week by week. I've been on it 5 months, and still have some content that will take months to unlock (Things like a juggling course, drumming, different dance courses, etc.). My current program involves specific breathing in the morning for 15 minutes, listening to theraputic music, about 12 minutes of neck exercises, eye tracking exercises, and sensory stimulation (more on that later). Then I do a 30 minute walk and meditate on my lunch break. After work, I do 6 minutes of shoulder exercises, 6 minutes of gentle mobilizations, and 15 minutes of dance. I know 'Vogue"" is what he's famous for, but there's a specific disco choreography that he provides. So it's a lot of work.\n\nSo, does it work? I don't know that it does for everybody. He has this big formula that calculates how well it will work for you, but the biggest factor by a large margin is how neuroplastic your brain is. But these are some facts that give me faith-\n\n1. He really does want people to get better. He's consistently adding content. He said in a seminar I attended that he'll work with people, and see that drumming will make people 5% better, so he'll add a drumming course. He also has a ""patient experience"" folder that has a lot of people that swear by him.\n\n2. I am better than I was 5 months ago. I'm not asymptomatic, but I am doing okay. I look at recovery as a 4-tiered pyramid of rehabilitation, medication, adaptation, and acceptance, and his program has given me something for rehabilitation and a lot of help with acceptance of where I am right now. \n\n3. So, in 2015, long before I had any dystonic symptoms, I had jaw surgery. The surgeon warned that there was like a 3% chance that I wouldn't regain feeling in my lower lip, and I fell into that category. The Surgeon also said that if the feeling wasn't back in a year, it never would be. So my lip has been numb for 5 years. As I've been doing this work, and I think it's specifically the sensory stimulation exercises, feeling has started coming back- it's been bonkers, but really gives me confidence that Farias knows what he's talking about- at least as much as anybody can.\n\nNow, a question for you, if you don't mind- do you know what doses you get when you get Botox? I got 50 in the SCM, and 90 in the splenius capitis. The neurologist implied that that was quite high for a first dose, but I'm curious what others get.",1625674213,t1_h4d3can,/r/Dystonia/comments/ofj7um/suckers_lollipops_have_been_my_salvation/h4d8tkh/
h4dua4p,ofj7um,"Thank you so much! I‚Äôve heard positive things about it but didn‚Äôt really know any details until now. It sounds like a variety of rhythmic movement is a significant part of it. I think music can be healing so it makes sense to me that ‚Äútuning‚Äù your body rhythms could be beneficial. That‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre getting feeling in your lip again as kind of a side effect! I don‚Äôt know the exact dosage for each muscle‚Äîhe switches it up sometimes‚Äîbut he mostly targets the SCM with a little in the traps, too. He did tell me that I get as much as anyone he treats that has dystonia in the neck only. I would happily try more, but he‚Äôs afraid I might develop swallowing or drooping issues with a higher dosage. Also, after about ten years of Botox, the SCM has shrunk quite a bit, to the point where it‚Äôs getting harder for him to find. Still fires like a champ, though.

gy1a6pv,n3wfow,"Female here, 31yo. I have had cervical dystonia my entire life. (Neck, not female cervix!) I give permission for you to share my comment, and for the reporter to use as they wish.\n\nI don't have any experience to share in regards to my current partner, we have not had sex yet. (Thanks covid, thanks Aussie border control /s).\n\nBut in my past experiences, if I'm particularly symptomatic I'll have trouble being on top, like I'll get dizzy and momentarily lose balance. If I am on bottom I might experience pain later depending on whatever I was doing with my neck at the time.\n\nI love giving oral if I'm in love with my partner. Problem is they tend to react by pulling my head and thrusting to hard in return. I can't go super fast, I'd rather just worship the peen if you know what I mean. But some guys require intense stimulation. This results in a lot of pain for me and can sometimes trigger a particularly horrible migraine (my neck pain will refer to my eyes, I'll end up with nausea and puking for hours until I pass out on the bathroom floor). I warn partner before not to be rough and don't use my head like a basketball, so when that happens I feel extremely disrespected.\n\nMy head tremors can occur and are sometimes super noticeable. I've had people ask me if I am cold. If it's a romantic interest I generally feel embarrassed when it's noticeable. \n\nIt really takes a loving partner to be gentle when I need it. I haven't experienced many guys who end up falling into this category. Although I'm sure my current partner will :)\n\nThat said I can still enjoy sex and intimacy. I just need ao.e understanding when I'm going through a rough time.\n\nSome people with dystonia HATE having those areas touched. For me, my neck is super errogenous. Neck kisses and gentle caresses in my most painful places make me melt and feel extremely appreciated. The ultimate panty dropper haha.\n\nHaving a partner who understands that I'm in pain even if he can't see it is very important. The kindness that can come with that understanding...I think it has the potential to help with keeping a strong bond and intimacy, at least for me. I can't describe the deep hurt and shame I've felt when it's minimized or they treat me like I'm being lazy. It's even been used as a gaslighting tool.

PKD is incredibly isolating.

hv2iifd,mtwl6j,"Hey everyone. I have the same movement disorder. I have been using carbamazepine since I was 16, so it‚Äôs been over a decade now. I believe I was diagnosed at 15? The other medications didn‚Äôt really work for me. I just want to let you know that it gets better. I was depressed in the beginning and could not function normally, I stopped playing sports and kind of withdrew from everyone at one point. Reading your post about walking on stage, that was always terrifying. Even when I get called at my local clinic, I always tend to have one. But thankfully as you age, these involuntary movements caused by voluntary movements happen way less. I used to take carbamazepine 2 times a day because I had those muscle spasms close to 50-100times a day and now I take carbamazepine once a week to once every two weeks.  \n\nIf anyone sees this, hope you are all living a great life!",1643676413,t3_mtwl6j,/r/Dystonia/comments/mtwl6j/found_new_solutiontool_ish_when_dealing_with/hv2iifd/

h4tflz4,mtwl6j,"Hello, thank you for letting me know! I will definitely look into carbazepine as an option. I'm sorry to hear that you're still going through attacks at that age and you're definitely right with the feelings of isolation. I've always tried to find others with similar conditions or a community but fail to. However, I'm glad to know there are others who experience the same thing! Feel free to stay in touch :) I feel less crazy knowing I'm not alone on this.\n\nLately, I have realised how over the years I've become more anxious, fatigued and overall have depressing thoughts... Which are side effects of my medicine. So I have been thinking of attending therapy or changing the type of medicine I'm taking. It's tough though I live in New Zealand and they don't have a large variety of medicine.\n\nPKD seems to be familial thing for me since one of my cousins and my aunt had similar symptoms which luckily went away in their adolescent years. Also, yes it still makes me sad that he gas to struggle with the same things especially since he mostly keeps things to himself and often doesn't bother to do stuff like taking a few seconds before standing up/ moving quickly... So he does get more attacks than me (additional from effects of hormones from adolescent). He has started taking a different medication from me, Epilim (Sodium Valproate) and I have seen a positive effect! So maybe you cab try that also? I haven't changed medicines yet since I've heard that can affect fertility but I will need to look into it.\n\nI try to give him tips/ advice without being to pushy and remind him that he can talk to me or ask for help. He mainly keeps to hinself though :') but I am continuously trying to break that barrier. Also, it helps when explaining how we act to our family... Especially when they want us to act quickly to get something like... you're gonna have to wait a bit lol\n\nThanks again for your advice and perspective, it means a lot!

I can mostly get away with having attacks with people who don't know I have this condition because of this :))\n\n-I try to move my feet a lot before standing up, crossing the road and moving in general!

Right now, I often find myself feeling a lot of negative emotions and also have noticed behavioural changes like being less enthusiastic to do anything for the first time- especially in front of people.

I couldn't control my movements and despite telling my family that I was fine we went to see the local doctor. They were unsure what it was so I had to get an MRI scan which led to me seeing a kids neurologist (I was maybe 12? When I first went to the doctors about this). From then I got blood work done to see if there's any other abnormalities. I stayed in the hospital for maybe 3-4 days during this time. Everything came out fine and so it was a mystery for awhile.\n\nOne day, I was talking to a kids doctors and they told me that I might have PKD based on my symptoms and also due to my relatives having similar symptoms in the past (hence it was passed down aka familial). From then they just put me on Levetiracetam as a trial and I've been on that since. Since your doctor doesn't seem to be listening to you I hope you've gone to see someone else instead!

Also, for meds in general, I've found that optimizing them isn't as simple as simply starting them, stopping them, or changing the dose.
