In response, my tonsils got removed in order to fix the sleep apnea under the assumption they were causing it. Well- it turns out it didn't cure it. I went 10+ YEARS being undiagnosed. At 18 I became literally disfunctional. We were doing zoom classes at that time and I would join but sleep through them. I was sleeping every moment I didn't have to do something else (work or school). Whenever I tried to be awake I would just randomly start dozing off. \n\nGot a sleep study. Turns out my sleep apnea didn't go away. I DO NOT SNORE. In retrospect, I really should've had a proper sleep study afterword to make sure it had gone away- but I absolutely do not blame my parents. My sleep apnea is very mild and you can't really tell if you're watching me sleep.",1651207120,t3_udy3pq,/r/SleepApnea/comments/udy3pq/provider_wont_give_me_a_sleep_study/i6mn88l/

i6iiv5o,ud92s6,"I‚Äôve been using a CPAP for 2+ years now ( for moderate sleep apnea). It‚Äôs truly been life-changing for me. No more crushing fatigue during the day. No more bad morning headaches. I know what ‚Äúrested‚Äù feels like now. I felt positive changes in about three weeks.\n\nAs another poster pointed out, there is a learning curve to using a CPAP. Hanging in there as you figure things out is important. I got some great tips from the forums CPAPtalk.com and apneaboard.com. \n\nBe sure to check out OSCAR (Open Source CPAP Analysis Reporter). This is a downloadable software (available on apneaboard.com) that collects detailed data about your sleep (by using an SD card in the CPAP machine).\n\nFinding the right mask is important and can take a while. I think I tried half a dozen over the past couple of years before I found one that worked best for me.\n\nFinding the right CPAP pressure is also really key. The ‚Äúlazy doctor settings‚Äù of 4-20 did not work for me. (I gradually bumped up the lower pressure to 7.) The knowledgeable folks at cpaptalk.com, and the info I gathered from using OSCAR, helped me figure this out. (Unfortunately, my sleep doc was of no help.)\n\nThe only ‚Äúside effect‚Äù I experienced with using a CPAP was aerophagia (swallowing air). Early on, this was sometimes painful (quite honestly). Took me a couple of months to find ways to minimize this. \n\nI encourage you to give CPAP a try!",1651139013,t3_ud92s6,/r/SleepApnea/comments/ud92s6/can_fatigue_improve_with_cpap_im_nervous_to_try/i6iiv5o/

How often do you wake? \n\nCertainly trying CPAP won't hurt, but it could take awhile to get used to, and you could lose a lot of sleep trying to acclimate to the therapy. I've had mine about a month and while I'm in compliance every night, I still sleep half the night without it because its uncomfortable and I still wake up every hour with it.\n\nIf you try CPAP and still have fatigue/poor sleep quality, it is more likely due to PTSD and anxiety and you might want to consider another route to recover from your fatigue.

i6h60a4,ucv9hv,"I started January 8th and had a lot of difficulties with a few good days here and there, but not consistently. I think (knock on wood) I am finally there, and it has taken this many months to see consistent improvement in sleep. I still wake up after 2-3 hours, but now I can fall back asleep again. For some people it just takes longer to work out what is comfortable for you. I made a lot of setting changes to get to where I am. It‚Äôs a steep learning curve for the first 3 months but definitely worth it. Finding the right mask is just step #1, for some people there are other settings that can be changed to make it more comfortable. I couldn‚Äôt give up because I have a problem that the CPAP obviously helps so had to stick it out even when I was miserable. Doc said I had better compliance than most and it is finally FINALLY starting to pay off. But I totally get why some people just give up. I would have too, but didn‚Äôt feel like I had a choice. My advice is to try to identify what is bothering you and keep changing things till you feel better enough to get reasonable amount of sleep with the cpap. For example in my case, I had to switch to autoset for her, EPR off, and I even reduced my pressure (NOT waiting for my doc. During my appointment with my doc later, he saw the setting changes and approved them-hard to argue with results). I also had to fight through issues with humidity and temperature. I also have to completely tape my mouth shut, without leaving even a tiny hole cause it will dry out my mouth and wake me up. Apparently everything wakes me up‚Ä¶ Not everyone is the same. Most people need heated air for comfort, but for some weird reason for me the heated air turned out to be exactly what was keeping me from sleeping, go figure! We are all different, you need to pay close attention to what is waking you up and try to change it. Unfortunately it takes a while and it sucks until you get it all right. Think of each night when it doesn‚Äôt work for you as new data you need to understand so you can figure out what needs to change.

i6d195d,uctjun,"It sounds like you've had someone helping you prepare, this all sounds exactly like what I would expect to happen!  I'm a nurse who works in the surgery recovery area (the room you wake up in after they are done, but before you go to your hospital room or go home), and we do surgeries like yours sometimes. Yes, you will have oxygen on, either a mask or in your nose, to help you wake up from the surgery. You will probably be very thirsty, and your throat is probably going to be sore. Your mouth may or may not hurt, the nurses will have medicine for you if it does. You might feel like you have to pee, that's very normal if they use something to empty your bladder during the surgery.\n\nYou also might be dizzy feeling or your stomach might be upset. The nurses have medicine that can help with the stomach, but the dizzy just takes some time. Go back to sleep if you can, it's the best way to get the medicine from the surgery to wear off. The nurses can let you have some ice or maybe a little water after you are more awake and if you don't feel sick to your stomach usually, though the doctor could say differently. The surgery team knows what they are doing, make sure you (or whoever is coming with you) talk to the anesthesia doctor the morning of. They can answer questions more specifically and will be the ones taking care of you while you are asleep for the surgery! Good luck!",1651033425,t3_uctjun,/r/SleepApnea/comments/uctjun/hi/i6d195d/

Didn‚Äôt even need a referral. I have chronic fatigue, ADHD and sinusitis in my charts and went to a doctor within the same medical group. No idea if they called for a referral or not. \nI was thinking maybe there‚Äôs something structurally wrong that‚Äôs causing or adding to the apnea. Plus I‚Äôm just really sick of being sick and tired all the time and want to explore all options.\n\nGotta say I‚Äôve been in the best mood since last week and am so happy I did this. First, I did a CT scan of my sinuses. Super easy took 3 minutes.\nThen, went across the street to the ENT office. I made sure to schedule my appointment with an ENT who also specializes in OSA. They sprayed me with a decongestant and asked me about my symptoms, why I came in that day, etc.\nI told them what had been going on but also wanted to hear what they had to say about my scans damnit!\nHe replied by saying that they like to talk to people first, as sometimes folks with good scans have horrible symptoms and look really bad when they do the scope up the nose and vice Versa. Oh yeah I got to watch the little TV as I watched them look around my sinuses after the decongestant started to work. It was super cool.\n\nThey said the scans confirmed the types of symptoms I‚Äôd been having. Badly blocked sinuses and all the air I‚Äôm breathing is being filtered through gunk because I‚Äôm never open enough for proper filtration to happen, hence any sort of inflamation causing sickness and blockage. Also said my septum was fine structurally but inflamed.\n\nBasically the air im getting has to make its way through a ton of yucky blockage. Which explains the fatigue, and getting sick often. So some nasal surgery is definitely on the table but we will do conservative approach first per my instruction and they referred me to an allergist, called in prescription nasal sprays plus we will monitor symptoms are staying in touch. Follow up in 8 weeks.\n\nIf symptoms improve then there you have it. If not, might be good to explore doing some procedures in there to open up the passage way and get me more and better air. They have outpatient procedures (Vivaer procedure?) now so im happy with the convos and it feels good seeing a scan of something you know is there so I know im not just crazy! \n\nI would definitely recommend seeing an ENT or doing a scan if you can. Im so happy i have the scan as data and proof that im experiencing constant blockage and it's just made me feel like a big weight is lifted. I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs all in my head.

My ex is 5'3 (1.6m) and 135# (61.2kg), skinny as a rake, and he has sleep apnea.\n\n>I had an AHI of 14.1 and worst oxygen desat was 78%  \n>  \n>I‚Äôm only mild so wasn‚Äôt sure I would treat...\n\nIn the US, 14.1 is the high end of mild, and ""mild/medium/severe"" are BS distinctions anyway. I had 22 and I felt fine every day, and my ex had 5.0 (which is the absolute minimum for a sleep apnea diagnosis) and he was a complete wreck if he fell asleep without his CPAP. \n\nAs a sleep technician you should know that with O2 of 78%, you really must treat. I was in the hospital a few years ago and they went completely nuts and put me on oxygen if my O2 dropped below 95%. (Seriously, it was 94.8% and they stuck a canula in my nose.)\n\n>...to be fair, it was one of the worst nights of sleep due to already being sleep deprived and external factors like a fire alarm...\n\nAs a sleep technician you should know that those things don't really matter in the end, the test can get good data anyway. \n\nI deliberately made myself a little sleep deprived so I could fall asleep easily in the hospital for the test. It worked, they hooked up wires and sensors all over me and I was out like a light.\n\n>...after pursuing this sub-reddit, I‚Äôve decided to look into treatment!\n\nYay! As a sleep technician, you should know that that's the right decision! I hope you're going to feel worlds better. I assume that in your line of work you have access to all the resources to fix the minor problems we all deal with when we start, but of course talk to us if you want more advice.\n\n>Thanks everyone and sadly welcome me!\n\nWelcome, glad to have you here, I'm sure you're gonna do great. This is probably going to give you a new perspective you can bring to your patients. You will discover that almost everyone has minor irritants when they start, that these minor irritants may seem like a big deal even if they're not, that patience and attention to trying things will solve problems quickly enough, and when it's all fixed CPAP treatment isn't ""sadly"", it's just sorta there and you do it and don't really think about it, or at best you may actively like it and be happy you have it. (I have good nights and meh nights, but I have a friend who is super happy with it every night.) \n\nWhat I would encourage you to bring to your work (from this learning experience) is a positive attitude toward treatment (""it may seem like it's going to be hard but after a couple weeks of being a minor irritation it'll be just fine as long as you pay attention to working out any problems with help from us"") and the understanding that most patients have minor problems at first and by talking to their vendor, their doctor, or folks like us, they can work out those sort of problems quickly and easily in most cases.\n\nWhen I had my test, it was kinda reassuring that the tech had in fact had the test so he knew the experience when he was hooking me up with all the wires and sensors, and he also had CPAP. I had 9 friends who had CPAP, two of whom I had lived with, so there was nothing surprising to me. I went into the test not knowing if I had apnea or not, but knowing that if I did it wouldn't be bad in the end and that there would probably be some small problems to work out, and that was all from knowing people who had CPAP.",1651013222,t3_uce6cj,/r/SleepApnea/comments/uce6cj/accidentally_found_out_i_have_sleep_apnoea/i6bte5y/

i68snqx,ubvoet,"Im 40+ yrs old, I'm about 5'5 in 260lbs to 270lbs, with sleep apnea. Yea, I always get the ""You need to lose weight"" advice.  I go to the gym 3 or 4 times a weeks (been going for 12 years now), doing weights and cardio where I'm sweating buckets. I eat like twice a day, try to do portion control.  I try to watch my carbs and sugar.  I take my vitamins and supplements. I use the CPAP the majority of time, unless I forget. Yes the CPAP definitely works.  It's helps me get a sleep and I don't wake up groggy or tired throughout the day.  However, my weight hasn't significantly dropped.  So it's not like I'm not putting any effort.  \nI don't know if it's Cushing's Disease or what.  \n\nLast time I made a significant weight drop was like 3 years on a very strict low carb and on hypertension meds, dropped down to 240lbs. I'm still doing low carb. But no long on hypertension meds\n\nA few doctors suggested bariatric surgery. I'm about the size of Jack Black, not the people you see on My 600lbs Life.  I'm not going through 8 buckets of KFC or 12 boxes of pizza.  So there is something else at play here with my body.\n\nI saw once went to see a dentist that does maxillofacial surgery for sleep apnea. He took an x-ray of me, and said that wasn't any significant fat around my neck that would cause the sleep apnea. However, he suggested two things.  Lose weight and then get another sleep study to see if I still have sleep apnea, because the ENT doctors won't let up on that. Then also get a doctor to look at my nasalüëÉ study with a scope to see if there is any problems there, like adenoids or polyps. Easier said then done. \n\nI was told I was a loud snorer either in adolescent or my teen years, but I was very lean back then. I always had an issues with my nose. People tell me that I talk through my nose.  Could never breath properly through it.  In cold wet air, my nasal passages really open up. In dry hot air, it's really clogs up.  I also been a mouthbreather for as long as I can remember.  So I deeply believe that the cause of my apnea is with my nose. Only problem finding a doctor who will recognize that and help treat me. \n\nI'm saying all this to say yeah, eating right, exercise, vitamins and supplements and using the CPAP is a great thing to do, to help improve your health.  However, it might not drop any significant weight.  There might be one or more things that's causing the weight gain and or the apnea. Some on here say that doctors deeply care about your health and don't want you to die.  That's true for a lot of doctors. However, some doctors gotta God Complex and don't listen to their patients.  Doctors are known for misdiagnosing patients. You could go to 5 different specialist doctors and they won't all agree. \n\nSo while you are eating right and exercising, also research the history of your health. Really take time to choose a great doctor WHO LISTENS to their patients. Try to advocate for yourself and let your thoughts, wishes, and concerns be clear with the doctor.  \n\nI hate that I had through years of being told lose weight and the apea might go away or not.  Then also hearing later on, that I might have other issues that can cause sleep apnea.\n\nBest of luck, sorry for the long post.",1650964169,t3_ubvoet,/r/SleepApnea/comments/ubvoet/i_have_an_appointment_to_get_referral_for_sleep/i68snqx/

In fact they are often too far gone to even qualify for the surgery for safety issues with anesthesia and have to lose a significant amount of weight first to be healthy enough to go under. \n\nI would recommend you watch secret eaters, it's a British show and you can find it on YouTube. It was eye opening for me and what helped me finally lose weight. Also, the gym might actually be the reason you are not able to lose, this was my experience too, because it makes you hungry and you tend to eat more and excerising actually burns way fewer calories than people think. You would be better off spending the time in the gym in the kitchen instead of weight loss is you primary goal. That time should be spent weighing, not measuring, weighing your portions and tracking your calories. And tracking everything you eat, people as you will see in that program, often leave out snacks and drinks, especially alcohol, which throws everything off where they think they are eating 2k calories a day but are in fact eating 4k calories. They think something is wrong with them but at the end of the day they are just consuming way more calories then they are burning off. Everyone thinks they have some medical issue that causes them not to lose weight, but it's just overconsumption at the end of the day and ones perception and reality of what they are actually eating is not aligned. \n\nYour body will thank you, the quality of life important is amazing, you kind of just accept that certain things are normal when you are fat but in fact it's not and you realize that once you have lost the weight. I might not help your sleep apnea, I actually got diagnosed a year after losing the weight, but will help your overall health and could decrease the severity of your sleep apnea.\n\nEdit also you don't have to cut out all the foods you like.

I have taken numerous Night Owl tests (5 or 6 nights over time) and for me the results show the doctors that everything is normal. It wasn't until years of trying different therapies and switching sleep doctors that I was finally ordered an in-lab overnight study in the hospital which showed my apnea is positional. When I first was thinking I had sleep apnea 6 or 7 years ago, I was ordered a home test with a device attached to my chest, a finger sensor, tube that measured breathing through my nose and some other connections to my body from the device in the middle. That showed I had sleep apnea, but wasn't precise enough to show the positional nature of it, or at least the doctors never bothered to mention that to me. Depending on your symptoms and the severity of your symptoms, the Night Owl may or may not give you the results you need to get treatment. If you aren't feeling rested and the Night Owl doesn't show anything like mine, push your doctor for other test alternatives that may be available. I snore a lot and found an oral appliance works best for me. I tried cpap for a year which was useless for me and only made my issues worse.

i65h6fs,uboo3g,"from the Mask Primer  [http://www.apneaboard.com/wiki/index.php/Mask\_Primer](http://www.apneaboard.com/wiki/index.php/Mask_Primer)\n\nthe tongue trick is what you want to learn, but it takes time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMouth Breathing  \nMouth Breathing is when you open your mouth and the air pressure from your PAP is venting out your mouth typically showing on your charts as a large leak which can substantially negate the effectiveness of your therapy. It is generally not good. The solution varies depending on the person  \n  \nWith OSCAR look at your Leak Rate graph where it is shaded (large leak/ LL), flat tops on this graph suggest mouth breathing. In OSCAR right click on the left header of the Leak Rate graph and click on Dotted Lines then select ""Leak Rate Upper Threshold"" to get a line across the graph for ResMed. Manually set the value for Philips Respironics. Severity depends on how much over this threshold and for how long it is in the Large Leak territory.  \n  \nHow to manage Mouth Breathing, not in any particular order.  \n  \n**Tongue Trick.** Place the tongue on the roof of the mouth, Practice during the daytime. The idea is to train the tongue that this is a good place to be, does not happen overnight, but it works for some. The tongue trick is where you want to be but it takes a lot of time and some people just cannot get it. Place the tongue on the roof of your mouth and breathe with your mouth shut. Breathing thru your nose, right? Now leaving the tongue where it is open your mouth, you should still be breathing thru your nose. Now that you have that down move your tongue, breathing thru your mouth right? OK, put your mask on, under pressure, and repeat the above. Expect to need to turn your machine off when you start to repeat. Add talking while under pressure, It takes a while to get any of this down. It took me months. The exercises above are to help you understand the positions that cause the issue and how to correct it. For all this to become automatic will take a while.  \n  \n**Cervical Collar.** A ""soft"" Cervical Collar (Releaf is popular). This helps support and align the neck and keeps the jaw/mouth from dropping. This is becoming a very popular option. Rarely used prior to mid 2016. Users are posting a high success rate with this device. When OA tends to occur in clusters at different times of night. It's an indication that an obstruction may have occurred when the chin tucks towards the chest. It's common, and the solution is either an ergonomic pillow or soft cervical collar that prevents the neck and head from being out of alignment and cutting off the airway, but they can be comfortable, prevent leaks and prevent an airway from closing up due to tucking your chin to chest and other issues. An Anti-Snoring collar or Sleep Collar, which has a small strap in back also works. (Dr. Dakota is popular)  \n  \nIt's a very small investment that has worked very well for some people. More pressure may solve the obstruction, or it might go away with positional therapy.  \n  \n**Chin Strap.** A chin strap is to manage mouth leaks from a variety of causes. Most result from the jaw-dropping or opening either partially or wider. The chin strap is to gently keep the jaw closed. If you have to crank it shut to make it work this is not the correct solution. Note that your jaw is strong enough to open if it wants to. There is one chinstrap that is notably different than others, Knightsbridge Dual Chin Strap which pulls up instead of back. Search for it if you desire.  \n  \n**Ergonomic Pillow or CPAP Pillow,** The purpose is to maintain a proper head and neck alignment while allowing for the mask maintaining the seal in multiple positions.  \n  \n**Mouth Guard** The concept here is a closed mouth guard to keep the air from leaking out.  \n  \n**Taping**. Definitely the most controversial. The purpose of taping is to seal the lips and prevent mouth leaks/mouth breathing. It is not to stop the mouth from opening. I make sure that I can easily open my mouth when taped, if I need to.  \n  \n**FFM** ‚Äì Full Face Mask or Hybrid Mask. This is a very traditional solution and it is generally effective.  \n  \nDry mouth is a symptom mouth breathing that is uncomfortable. It can and does occur with some users of a Full Face Mask.  \n  \nMany users use a product called Biotene to get relief from this symptom.",1650905938,t3_uboo3g,/r/SleepApnea/comments/uboo3g/possible_to_prevent_cheeks_from_puffing_out/i65h6fs/

These settings will help your apnea but aren't optimized by any means. The fastest way of finding the right settings is by taking control of your therapy. That means buying an APAP that is data capable with an SD card, and looking at the data with [OSCAR](http://www.apneaboard.com/wiki/index.php/OSCAR_Help) and adjusting accordingly.

A form of AF is sporadic in nature and hard to confirm or even arrive at an ER still showing the symptoms.  \n\nLet's look at Sleep apena first.  There are home study systems that can diagnose the.most.common forms of SA.  Internet firm like Lofta offer home study systems for $300 - 500.  Some US insurance companies start with the results from home studies to.justify the.more expensive tests and medical attention and finally any treatment equipment needed is justified.  \n\nAtrial Fribillations can come sporadically or start and refuse to revert usually called persistent.  Your heart palpitations sound like it might be the sporadic type.  \n\nTo produce evidence of sporadic events.  The best way I know is to either wear a continous pulse taking watches or rings. The second best is touching a KardioMobile pad for 30 seconds, which will hopefully see your palpitation in progress. Both this device and the Apply Series 7 watch have math algorithms that read their ECG input looking for four different patterns, with two of those involving fast pulsed AF.  A used 2 lead KM touch pad can be bought for as little as $30 from the likes of EBay.  Used touch pads can be sanitized with an alcohol cloth wipe.\n\nMost pulse measuring and recording watches and rings data can usually be presented to the ReadMyECG app to evaluated for a AF pulse patterns.\n\nThere are two AF oriented sub here r/Afib and r/AtrialFibrillation.",1650856615,t3_ubafm8,/r/SleepApnea/comments/ubafm8/is_it_sleep_apnea_always_feel_sleepy_and/i6330bp/

i615p0v,uazm8e,"I'm from there as well. Canada is good for free sleep studies, so I would definitely leverage free CPAP titration. One thing which is very important in my opinion is to ensure the lab scores hypopneas based on the [recommended hypopnea definition, AASM 1A](https://aasm.org/aasm-clarifies-hypopnea-scoring-criteria/). Especially people who have less BMI, you can get a false negative or under-diagnosis for the AHI when AASM 1B is used, so I would recommend calling the lab ahead of time to ask about it, since you don't want to go through all the trouble just to have them say you don't have sleep apnea.\n\nI consulted Dr. Kasey Li virtually, so it's an option but like I said really expensive and you need a CBCT scan as well to send to him. If you're considering surgery I would also recommend joining the r/UARSnew discord server since a lot of us are in a similar situation and can help each other out.\n\n>The nose surgery isn‚Äôt purely for sleep apnea I can‚Äôt breathe most of the time through my nose , but I thought I just had stuffy nose but CT scan showed it‚Äôs narrow didn‚Äôt know before ym sleep study\n\nI've had the nose surgery as well, I'm just warning you it's not a sleep apnea surgery. It won't really reduce the AHI or improve the condition. Best case scenario your CPAP is a bit easier to tolerate. My feeling, as someone who did it myself, is that the risks (empty nose syndrome for example, which I know people who it has happened to) outweigh the benefits. I would recommend a sleep apnea surgery which has more statistical success based on your anatomy.\n\n>I‚Äôve lost over 40lbs since I was diagnosed with sleep apnea lowering my BMI significantly with no reduction sadly .\n\nThere is that stereotype, but they actually found for a lot of people losing weight hardly even affects the AHI. In a study of people >35 BMI, they found gastric bypass cured about 55% of them, with an average reduction in AHI of 64%. So it either will have a big impact or it will have a tiny impact. Almost half barely even responded so that really tells you that weight isn't even the primary factor for OSA, because the study didn't even include all the people below 35 BMI who would respond even less so.\n\n>My tonsils are oversized but they won‚Äôt remove them or touch them I‚Äôve asked twice and both times they said it‚Äôs not worth it\n\nUsually I wouldn't recommend it as a first-line OSA surgery unless everything else is fine, so yeah I agree with that at least for now. Maybe as a last resort. I've heard it really hurts like a bitch when you're an adult as well.\n\n>Seems there‚Äôs a lot to it , which sucks my life is severely impacted with several health issues and hard to tell which is causing what symptom , they‚Äôve ruled out my tiredness from any other of my issues so just frustrating , each day trying to just get by\n\nI can relate to your sentiment.

I don't suffer anxiety from it, but perhaps if you are subject to this (sorry to hear that if so), your physician could address it separately. My point was that it is recognized among doctors who study sleep disorders that residual sleepiness cannot be ruled out for some patients who are fully compliant with CPAP therapy if they have a significant history of untreated sleep apnea. That's my understanding. My pulmonologist prescribed Modafinil since I fit this profile: years of untreated severe sleep apnea, fully compliant, low ahi after therapy (< 1 typically) and still I needed to take naps during the day. Modafinil made a very significant difference. It has to be treated with respect though. I cannot take 100mg at lunchtime or in the afternoon.

Note that I said ""untreated"" apnea.  It's good that you're getting an EKG and blood work to rules out other problems, but the one sure way to know if you suffer with sleep apnea is to have an overnight sleep study done.  This can be expensive, especially if your lacking insurance coverage.  \n\nSnoring is only one symptom of sleep apnea.  How do you sleep in general?  Do you find yourself waking up several times a night?  Are you tired during the daytime?   Is there anyone you live with that can observe you while you sleep or have noticed if you stop breathing during the night, or wake gasping for air?  \n\nAgain, try to get tested.  Mention these symptoms to your doctor and suggest you need a sleep study done.  \nSome doctors can even set you up with an in-home overnight study, which would be cheaper.  \n\nBottom line, don't ignore this.  If you do have sleep apnea, it's rare that it will improve without being treated with a continuous positive air pressure machine (CPAP).  \n\nAlso, start googling the subject.

i5yb7s7,uafnax,"I‚Äôm only two months in and have tried five masks. None work great. \n\nStarted with the air touch n20 - it‚Äôs the memory foam one. Horrible. The foam is angled inwards so the sharp edge of the mask dug directly into my face.  I do not understand their design. Put the foam cushion between the mask and the user. \n\nI tried the nasal pillows one with the air tube off the top. LOVE that the air tube off the top and no extreme stream of air blowing out at my hands and pillow. (Airfit p30i). However, after a few days my nasal passages became irritated by the extreme air flow and swelled up and no air could get through. \n\nTried the airfit f30i. Thought this would be good. Nope. The distance between my nose and the mask was all wrong. No seal. \n\nTried the airfit n20 cushion that was in the packaging with the air touch. This one has actually worked the best of all. I e used it more nights than any other. Good seal even when I side sleep and grind my face into my pillow.  However, I find I open my mouth at night and the air races out that way and totally dries out my mouth. \n\nI tried a chin strap with the n20. This works but gave me EXTREME jaw pain. After only two nights use, my jaw seized shut and started clicking. It‚Äôs now two weeks since the last time I used the chin strap and my jaw still hurts but is 75% better. Not doing that again. \n\nLastly I‚Äôve tried a airfit f20. The full face mask. The seal isn‚Äôt as good as the n20 but it‚Äôs decent. And it‚Äôs easier to keep my mouth shut since air isn‚Äôt trying to force its way out that way. I don‚Äôt like the air tube coming out at mouth level but I‚Äôm kinda stuck with it. All the ones that come out on top have that weird fit directly under the nose which irritates my nasal passages too much. \n\nThis is NOT easy.",1650766904,t3_uafnax,/r/SleepApnea/comments/uafnax/what_type_of_mask_do_you_find_the_most_comfortable/i5yb7s7/

I haven't ever tried using a chin strap but my preference was to not use one while I sleep.\n\nSo I settled with the nasal mask + medical tape to tape my mouth shut so I can use the nasal.

Basically these occur when your pressure is too high for your body to tolerate, and so you get a central apnea.

I had a 20 mm wide nasal aperture, hypertrophied turbinates, deviated septum, tonsils, and severe maxillomandibular hypoplasia (20 mm), mallampati score IV, etc. I'm at the point now, where if I so much as relax the muscles around my throat, my entire airway will seal up and I'll suffocate, so I cannot relax if I want to breathe.

i65yegr,u9xop9,"I have suffered the same exact thing. It could be sleep apnea, BUT it could also be GERD. I always thought mine was just sleep apnea, but it turns out GERD was at least partially responsible. What happens is air becomes trapped in your esophagus expanding it and putting pressure on your aorta, especially in certain sleep positions. The aorta can then pump very hard for a moment or two in response to the change in pressure causing a palpitation type feeling and intense panic. Understand that you don‚Äôt have to have the hallmark burning reflux sensation to have GERD, there are those like myself who are affected by silent reflux. I got mine to mostly go away by simply not eating close to bed time, consuming less acidic foods/drinks, and trying to sleep more upright. I also recently got a cpap because I was suffering some struggles there too, but even with the cpap I still had it. It wasn‚Äôt until I started treating for GERD that I saw it start to go away. Beyond that I still do get one of those from time to time, but those are for sure related to anxiety and not anything else, and those ones only happen as I initially fall asleep, they no longer wake me up in the middle of the night.

i6etk6c,u9xop9,"I hear you. It can be very challenging to separate the mental from the physical. Eg. Am I fatigued and anxious because I‚Äôm not getting enough sleep or am I not getting enough sleep because I am anxious. In some ways, it feels like the medical establishment has over-corrected when it comes to psychology and psychiatry. In the past, medicine ignored mental health and attributed mental health symptoms to physical health problems. Now, however, unexplained physical symptoms are often attributed to mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression, without further investigation of possible physical causes. It is important to investigate all avenues, physical and mental, If you are stuck. \n\nI only woke up from nightmares with a tense body verging on panic, on average, once a month, but I also took medication to sleep because I thought I had insomnia. I thought I was waking up like that because I had an anxiety problem. However, when I went in for a sleep study, I had what I thought was a ‚Äúnormal‚Äùnight, as in, I didn‚Äôt wake up in a panic. I didn‚Äôt sleep great, but I didn‚Äôt sleep terribly either. Then I got the results and I realized we have no idea what our body is doing when we‚Äôre asleep. I had sleep apnea and I had PLMD. I think what was happening during those rare nights where I woke up in a panic was that I was having a bad night for me, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that my normal was good, if you get what I‚Äôm saying. I had sleep apnea every night. \n\n\nI am athletic and I still had sleep apnea. Losing weight often improves sleep apnea symptoms to a degree, but you will find many people on this forum who lost weight, but still had sleep apnea. What you don‚Äôt want to do is lose weight, and think you fully treated it (because you aren‚Äôt having midnight panic episodes) when it‚Äôs really only partially treated and it‚Äôs still messing with your anxiety, depression, energy level, blood pressure, etc. If you were diagnosed with sleep apnea when you were overweight and then you lost weight, the next thing you would want to do is do another sleep study at the lower weight just to make sure you really solved the problem.\n\n If you have an eating disorder, it‚Äôs important to get your vitamin and mineral levels checked every year. I imagine anxiety about food and being monitored by a doctor could play into an eating disorder, so I don‚Äôt say this lightly. But the reason I‚Äôm saying it is I have noticed a fair number of women with iron deficiency with or without anemia who also have eating disorders. \n\nThe body is very careful about how it absorbs iron, meaning that it only allows a certain amount of iron to be absorbed every day. If you are going through periods where you are not eating enough And then playing catch up when your weight gets too low, your iron balance can slip into the negative because it‚Äôs not getting enough iron when you‚Äôre not eating enough and it‚Äôs not able to absorb the extra iron when you are eating enough. Over time, this can cause a deficiency. Symptoms of iron deficiency, with or without anemia, actually have some overlap with sleep apnea. Fatigue/low energy, difficulty falling and/or staying asleep, irritability, anxiety, depression, waking up gasping, etc. \n\nFood choices also matter. Heme iron, which is found in meat and fish, is a lot easier for the body to absorb than the non-heme iron found in plants and fortified foods such as cereal and pasta. Many plants, such beans, nuts, and grains actually contain chemical compounds that interfere with your body‚Äôs absorption of iron. So even though some of these same items can be relatively rich in iron, your body isn‚Äôt able to extract it. This is why vegans and vegetarians are at increased risk for iron deficiency. \n\nVitamin D, a vitamin our bodies make from the sun, is another common deficiency that can affect sleep and frequently appears with iron deficiency. While our skin can make vitamin D from sunlight, iron is necessary for the sunlight to chemically activate the vitamin D in our skin. Vitamin D is not found naturally in sufficient quantity in most foods. It is added to some food products, such as dairy and cereals, but if someone is avoiding or limiting certain food groups due to an eating disorder, they may not be getting enough vitamin D even with sun exposure due to complicating factors like an iron deficiency. \n\nA blood test for ferritin is the best easy measure for iron deficiency. Ferritin below 30 is considered an absolute iron deficiency, but patients can have symptoms of iron deficiency without anemia until their ferritin is consistently above 125.\n\nI don‚Äôt have an eating disorder, but I do have an iron deficiency, which is why I know so much about this. Before my sleep apnea was treated, I had chronic heartburn, which can sometimes happen with sleep apnea patients. I was eating tums like they were candy and the reduced stomach acidity was interfering with my absorption of iron. I only discovered I had an iron deficiency after doing a sleep study in a sleep lab. During the sleep study, they detected PLMD, which can be a symptom of iron deficiency. So my blood was tested for low ferritin and the rest is old news. If I had done a take home sleep test, they would not have been able to detect the PLMD, and I would have still been feeling like shit even though my sleep apnea was improving. \n\nFinally, many people find they have an easier time managing their weight once they have their sleep apnea addressed. Although I realize your situation is quite complex due to the eating disorder.\n\nI am writing all of this, one for you, in case you need it, but also for anyone who happens to come across this and realize that they may be experiencing something similar. The Moral of this long windbag of story is that I am glad you are doing a sleep study, make sure you do a lab study if you can afford it. I wish you the best of luck in healing, whatever that entails.",1651073241,t1_i6cwktk,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u9xop9/sleep_apnea_or_panic_attacks/i6etk6c/

They seriously thought having essentially a blinking flashlight pointed at their subjects eyes all night long wasn‚Äôt an issue. In. A. Sleep. Clinic. \n\nThey were annoyed that I wanted to wear my sweater to bed. Kept asking me if I was ready to take it off yet. No. I sleep in this. They weren‚Äôt convinced. \n\nThey wanted me to go to sleep with the television on. Ummmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt do that at home, why do you want me to do it here? Please turn the damned thing OFF. \n\nWhen I needed to pee in the middle of the night they turn all the lights on. But for some reason when you wake up in the morning they turn on like one 40 watt light and won‚Äôt turn on any others until after they‚Äôve removed all the wires.

That‚Äôs a great way to put out your neck. \n\nThere‚Äôs no bedside light nor was I allowed control over the lights. I naturally fall asleep by waiting until I‚Äôm sleepy. Reaching out to turn off my light, rolling over and going to sleep. Without that ritual, it was very hard to sleep. Why can‚Äôt we control our own light?? \n\nThe second study they used four times as much tape. In the morning the ripped it off quickly and actually tore my skin on my neck and I ended up bleeding. This was after I told them I was allergic to many adhesives. \n\nThe second study the woman who helped do the wire connections talked to me and the other woman like we were three year olds. Total baby talk. It was bizarre. \n\nFor both studies I wasn‚Äôt given the results until I requested them approximately 6 different times. They finally mailed a hard copy to my house because in 2022 they still cannot deliver them electronically. \n\nFor the pleasure of all this, my insurance was charged $5,000 each.

It'll probably be a ResMed and that's fine.\n\n2. It might take some time to get used to it. If it's hard, try a different mask, try putting it on when you are awake to get used to it. I use a full mask because my sinuses are garbage but lots of people prefer nasal. If you have a beard just keep it short and they work fine.\n\n3. Everyone's experience is different. Some take to it immediately, some not right away. Some feel like a god on morning one, others it takes a while. It is ok if it's a struggle. Just be patient.\n\n4. You can find many parts (mask parts and tubes and the like) sold without prescription on places like Amazon. They WILL be cheaper than your DME. Take advantage of that. I have been using the same mask for three years just by buying new gaskets and headgear online. It's still going strong.\n\n5.

It took 6 months for me to procure my first machine (4 years ago) through insurance.  They overcharged me and I ended up paying too much for everything, and my DME and sleep doctor were terrible.  Take my advice here please and do not use Insurance or DMEs or sleep doctors.  Demand a copy of your prescription (once you have that it'll be better to buy your own machine and you can purchase everything you need on ebay and amazon for masks and headgear) and self-titrate, we can help and so can the apneaboard forum, and do not worry about putting the mask on, after you're setup correctly you will view the mask as a life saving device, not something negative..  DM me if you want more details about my journey, it's a deep one.  \n\nThere are small things to do to make you sleep better as well with a cpap/apap/bipap/asv.  Please purchase a hose hanger so the hose does not rest on your body as you sleep, you can purchase them on amazon, also do not worry about cleaning much.  Get some mask wipes (baby wipes) and rinse out your humidifier chamber every day and let it air dry.  Also, your pressure settings will be set by people that won't worry about how to make your therapy comfortable.

The tongue trick is where you want to be but it takes a lot of time and some people just cannot get it. Place the tongue on the roof of your mouth and breathe with your mouth shut. Breathing thru your nose, right? Now leaving the tongue where it is open your mouth, you should still be breathing thru your nose. Now that you have that down move your tongue, breathing thru your mouth right? OK, put your mask on, under pressure, and repeat the above.

i5pbq85,u929ik,"I would also add the following:\n\n1) CPAP hygiene is really important for preventing mask leaks. Many people struggle to actually clean their mask daily, but to make this easier, buy some baby wipes and keep them near your bed. Use these to clean both your mask and face before bed. This gets rid of the oils that make the seal slippery. Of course properly cleaning your system is important for general hygiene, but keeping the seal oil free is critical for preventing leaks while you are getting used to it. \n\n2) If you experience severe dry mouth despite having the humidifier, this is because of leaks that you need to fix if you are going to tolerate CPAP.\n\n3) If you start with a nasal mask (either nasal pillows or over the nose) and you struggle because you feel like you can't breathe, then this is because of poor nasal passages. Similarly, poor nasal passages will also cause you to mouth-breathe and leak pressure through your mouth while you sleep. This is very common for OSA patients to have congested nasal airways. If it is bothering you too much then you will need to switch to a full face mask. \n\n4) Many people have really crappy sleep while they are first  getting used to CPAP. This is okay because once you get used to it, you will feel so much better! However, some people become trapped in this phase and become completely intolerant of CPAP. This all has to do with naps! I'll explain with an example: poor sleep during first few days/weeks with CPAP makes people even more tired. They then start taking naps because of this. This becomes a trap, because naps make it harder to fall asleep and particularly hard to fall asleep with the mask on. Lesson: never take naps when starting CPAP! \n\nOnce you start having positive experiences with CPAP it becomes a million times easier. In fact, you will become conditioned to associate CPAP with good sleep, and you won't want to sleep without it! This takes time and training to get there though. \n\nGood luck!",1650596530,t1_i5p5zls,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u929ik/hi_there/i5pbq85/

i5p6cmo,u90smw,"The bad news is sleep apnea doesn‚Äôt care about your lifestyle. You can do everything right and still wind up with high blood pressure in your thirties if you don‚Äôt treat the sleep apnea now. I‚Äôm athletic and speaking from experience. \n\nThe good news is you‚Äôre dealing with this now, which means you probably won‚Äôt spend the next ten years wondering what‚Äôs wrong with you. People in their twenties are often embarrassed about being on CPAP, but trust me, being awake and feeling good during the daytime is way sexier to whoever your interested in than dragging your tired ass around trying to keep your eyes open. \n\nAs for price, the take home sleep test is probably cheaper because it costs the sleep center less money to administer and analyze. However, if it turns out you don‚Äôt have sleep apnea and you have something else, like narcolepsy or PLMD, a take home test is absolutely worthless. Similarly, the take home test tends to be inaccurate for people with UARS or mild sleep apnea (hell even moderate sometimes). The sleep lab sleep study uses an EEG to measure your brainwaves, which is why it is so much more accurate than the take home test, which has fewer sensors and doesn‚Äôt have an EEG. Worst case scenario, you do the take home sleep study and it underestimates your events and your doctor either doesn‚Äôt take your sleep apnea seriously or says you don‚Äôt have it when you actually do. Then you have to either give up or pay for the more accurate and comprehensive sleep lab sleep study to verify the the accuracy of the take home test and check for conditions that a take home test can‚Äôt detect. \n\nBest case scenario, you do the take home test and you have a simple case of sleep apnea that is easy to detect and you have no other complications that the take home test would miss and you end up saving some money. \n\nAs a young, athletic man, if you do have sleep disordered breathing, you may be more likely to have UARS or mild sleep apnea because your brain probably wakes up quicker and is more sensitive to oxygen desaturation than someone who has been dealing with untreated sleep apnea for 30 years. For this reason, your better off doing the lab test.\n\nNow, if you aren‚Äôt working or you will be quitting soon, see if you can enroll in whichever Medicaid or Healthcare.gov health insurance plan has the lowest deductible and covers sleep studies and CPAP machines. Some health insurance companies require a take home test before they will pay for a lab test and other health insurance companies require a lab test before they will cover a take home test. Unfortunately, sleep apnea can get expensive because you may want to do a titration study or an MSLT after you do a diagnostic study, or you may need a BiPAP because a CPAP isn‚Äôt doing the trick. Maybe you need to see your sleep specialist several times a year while you‚Äôre trying to figure things out or you may need to see an ENT to treat congestion or check for a deviated septum. If you have a low deductible plan, you could end up saving a lot of money. \n\nHope this post has been more helpful than overwhelming, sleep apnea is a chronic condition that‚Äôs kind of just the luck of the draw, so it can take real adjustment if you‚Äôre a young guy used to thinking of yourself as healthy and a little invincible. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you get this thing treated so you can move on with your life and get back to feeling in top shape.",1650593967,t3_u90smw,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u90smw/just_got_a_quote_from_my_sleep_clinic_but_they/i5p6cmo/

i5o8c9m,u8rabd,"Sleep studies in lab are considered the gold standard for determining what is going on with your sleep. An ENT may be able to get an idea of what is going on with your airway through DISE, the procedure you are referring to, but DISE is not considered as good as a sleep study for a couple reasons.\n\n1. It‚Äôs heavily drug induced, and the thinking is that this may affect your airway differently than regular sleep.\n\n2. While anatomy general plays a role in sleep apnea, it is often more complicated than something just getting in the way. For example, relaxation of a large base of the tongue during sleep is a common reason for apnea. The reason why we aren‚Äôt all choking on our tongues during the daytime is that our brain tenses the muscles of the tongue during every breath while awake. You‚Äôre not aware of this happening, but it‚Äôs happening. During sleep, some people‚Äôs brains have less muscle control of their airway than others and the brain has to actually wake up to protect the airway, causing sleep disturbance. An ENT isn‚Äôt able to wait around for different stages of sleep to see what‚Äôs going on. They knock you out and hope for the best during a short procedure. Respiration is a complex activity that involves many systems, visualization with a camera during drug induced endoscopy (DISE) cannot observe all the parts of the system. This is why an EEG that measures your brainwaves during a lab sleep study is diagnostic. It is directly measuring the ultimate consequences of every aspect of your sleep apnea anatomy and physiology. This is also one of the reasons why many sleep apnea surgeries don‚Äôt have an amazing success rate: an ENT can only treat what they can see. They aren‚Äôt going to be able to help you out with your physiology.\n\n3. You are assuming you only have sleep apnea. A DISE procedure can‚Äôt tell you if other sleep disorders, such as PLMD, are contributing to your condition, a sleep lab sleep study can provide much more information, enabling you to treat/target other disruptions to your sleep. This is also the reason why you want to do a sleep study in a lab vs. at home. At home tests are screening tools for sleep apnea only.

i5jqjit,u88wzh,"If you're having nightmares of suffocating, gasping for air, you may be desaturating enough for the home study to detect it. By the way, severity of desaturation is not severity of a sleep disorder, you can have very little desaturation but very severe symptoms.\n\nTypically non stereotypical OSA cases desaturate less, so in those cases it's usually recommended to do the PSG which is usually in-lab. It's usually the more stereotypical cases who gasp for air though so maybe you could land somewhere in-between on the stereotypical to non stereotypical spectrum of OSA.\n\nIf you do a sleep study just make sure, and this is very important, that if it is a non PSG sleep study (usually HSAT) that it is scored using the 3% hypopnea definition, and if it is a PSG that it is scored under the [AASM recommended definition AASM 1A](https://aasm.org/aasm-clarifies-hypopnea-scoring-criteria/) (3% + arousal). These definitions are designed to avoid false negatives in non stereotypical cases which may desaturate less.\n\nUsually my problem with home studies is that if it comes back negative, the doctor will just say you don't have a sleep disorder, but if someone has severe symptoms that's not really good enough, I want to see a PSG because it has more information, it counts those arousal hypopneas, it's more accurate, it shows the arousal index and real hypnogram, and it shows how much time you slept in each stage of sleep. All of those things are very important in figuring out whether someone has a sleep disorder or not.

Major leaks are a different matter. You can see leaks in the leak graph on OSCAR\n\nYou could also have flow limitations that are not counted as events because they are only minor blockages to airflow.

Some people have great results and wake up feeling like a new person after one night but that's far from a universal experience.

You might actually get some help from them, but don't count on it.  Learn how to operate your equipment, how to change your settings and how to experiment with different settings, masks, etc.  The equipment manufactures and suppliers care about one thing, and one thing only, and that is making money, so shop around and educate yourself.\n\nOne last thing, and this is the silver lining, is that communities like this and r/CPAP exist.  You will almost certainly find more support and actionable information here than you're ever likely to get from a doctor.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and reach out for help.

i5iekgr,u81060,"Well, snoring is a symptom of an underlying issue to my knowledge. The issue is that air cannot flow as freely, because the throat collapses on itself either partially or fully. Most people who snore have obstructive sleep apnea, because that causes all of the issues including snoring.\n\nThat is a long way of saying snoring is the result of issues, not the cause in and of itself. Snoring is a symptom itself.\n\nThe best way to know for many people is to try treating it with APAP/CPAP. Lab testing is not perfect either and I know of people who aren't even medically classified as having sleep apnea because their AHI is below 5.0, but they still treat it and feel/see the difference.\n\nWhen the person is going through insurance and the local DME, they often have an option of a monthly trial. They can try it for a few months and see if they feel better. If they do, the doctor is more able to show insurance their compliance data and that it's helping with symptoms, and the insurer will approve the expenses.\n\nThis is not always the easiest process, but it's up to you. If it were me, especially knowing how impactful it was in my own life, I'd try treatment. The only downside is if you have to buy the equipment outright, you need to be okay with the financial risk.

I have an airsense 10 autoset and it has a feature to reduce pressure when you breathe out. \n\nAs for your nostril, first off I'm not a doctor. But I had the same sort of thing I noticed after I started looking into apnea treatment. According to my doctor it's normal for one side of your nose to always be breathing better, and one side to be ""clogged"" more. The tissue swells for one side vs the other in a cycle throughout the day to keep your nostrils from drying out and that's just a normal thing. If you always notice it in bed my thought is that maybe it's just how it lines up time wise. If during the day that side is easier to breathe out and the other side feels more clogged it's likely normal.

You can reduce the turbinates, kind of evict some people from the house, or you can make a bigger house by expanding the skeletal structure. For reducing AHI it's the skeletal surgery that works much better.\n\nSo I would consider CPAP for now, and for surgery I would recommend a sleep apnea surgery, which nasal surgery is not really.\n\nIf you're really interested in going the cure route as opposed to CPAP route I would recommend joining the discord at r/UARSnew.

i5hyfz5,u7z1ar,"An ahi of 33 is severe sleep apnea and needs treatment with pap therapy. Cpap has an EPR setting (expiratory pressure relief) that you can set from 1-3. So if you're pressure is 10cmh2O,  your exhalation pressure is 7 and your inhalation pressure is 10 when set to epr of 3. A cpap machine has a max pressure setting of 20cmh2O and a bipap/bilevel machine has a max setting of 30cmh2O. \n\nBipap is mainly for people who need much higher pressure or patients who can not tolerate cpap. The bipap machine will allow you to set a pressure relief similar to the cpaps EPR but with a larger gap from 4-10cmh2O instead of the cpaps 1-3. You will typically need a second sleep study with cpap the entire night of sleep to see what pressure or machine type you will need. \n\nAs for your nasal issue whenever I have patients with any nasal congestion or deviated septum I will have them use a full face mask.

i5egv3h,u7gg1b,"Sleep studies are an annoyance to most, but are vital in the diagnosis of sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. Fight for an in lab study as opposed to an at home study, if you can.\n\nYou'll go to a lab, the nicer ones are underground hotels where you have your own bedroom and bathroom with amenities like a celling fan, comfortable bed, TV, and shower for the morning. The not great ones are a hospital style room with a hospital bed and possible a communal restroom with no showers. I have had a sleep study done in both kind of settings and preferred the former for obvious reasons. \n\nYou'll arrive later in the evening and they will explain the process. You'll change into your sleep attire and then the techs will spend some time gluing and taping sensors to your arms, head, face, chest, and legs. They will plug all these sensors into a block that you can wear around your neck or hold when you need to get up and move around to do something like go to the bathroom. Most places will then let you hang out until you are ready to go to bed. Sometimes they will request that you go to bed by a certain time to make sure they can get enough data or make sure that the staff is utilizing their time efficiently. The worst part for me, was knowing there was someone watching and listening. But, it was also nice because I was a teen when I did my first one and I knew that I could get help quickly if I needed it. \n\nSometimes they will do a ""split night"" study where they will fit you with a mask before you go to sleep and then if your data is suggesting a diagnosis, the tech will wake you up and put the mask on you at a certain time. They will then use the rest of the night to figure out the pressure settings for the CPAP you will likely be prescribed by remotely dialing the machine up and down until they eliminate the majority of disturbances while also not setting the pressure so high that your body has to struggle to actually breathe naturally. If they do not do a split night, then they will either prescribe an auto adjusting PAP or will have you come back in for a titration study to set the PAP levels appropriately.",1650405437,t3_u7gg1b,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u7gg1b/sleep_study/i5egv3h/

It sounds like your OSA is probably mostly comprised of hypopnea/RERAs, so the AHI the CPAP is telling you is probably totally meaningless.

What kind of study did you have done?  If you have that high functioning a job I would also suggest buying an autosetting APAP on craigslist, cpap may not be enough for you. Read up on apneaboard and cpaptalk to learn more about this.  Don't wait months for a machine - buy a new one on craigslist after doing the homework, follow up on those forums to get your settings optimized for you.  Try different masks, try ALL THE THINGS.\n\nAlso - having worked in a high hours high intensity setting - you need to get a handle on your eating.  It is a major contributor to this.  And that is driven by your work habits and likely psychological factors of how you reward and comfort yourself.  You can't outwork/outrun your mouth when it comes to weight loss, and excess weight is making the GERD and OSA worse.\n\nNot sleeping well makes it very hard to lose weight.  Treat the GERD, get CPAP/APAP working for you, and tackle the eating. You can do it.\n\nSpend the money on yourself to get all of this right.  As a parent you are way more likely to spend the money on kids and sacrifice yourself and your needs.  This is about them, spend on yourself to get well so you will be around and healthy to give them your time and energy and remain able to earn for them.

So you can use a p30i or n30i nose piece on the same headgear.  Which will save some money as a trial.\n\nFor me, I actually started off with full face masks, because the respiratory tech that fitted me years ago for a mask said I mouth breathe so voila, FFM.  Of course, through my own research and experience, I learned later on that my apnea probably contributed to my mouth breathing and that recently I've found nasal masks actually do wonders for me, but you have to train yourself to close your mouth or force it shut some other way (e.g. mouth tape).\n\nMy mask journey have been years of using FFM, then in the last month or so switching to nasal -> nasal pillow -> back to nasal and I finally found my perfect fit by trying various masks.

i58ltfc,u6idas,"DOME is not ideal, especially at Stanford with the way they do it is not very good, way too invasive and often not great for sleep apnea. Ideally you want EASE with Dr. Kasey Li, but his prices are ridiculously high at this point due to the demand, though more surgeons are starting to do it. It's kind of debatable whether to do expansion then MMA or MMA then expansion if needed, generally what I would say is if you can get a large advancement with MMA and your nasal aperture is >23 mm wide you could consider expansion first optional. Unless you have a really large mandible usually the expectation is that the expansion alone probably isn't going to cure you. Counter-argument is that not everyone is cured after an MMA either, especially sub 14 mm.\n\nWhen it comes to MMA that is really something you want to make sure is done properly. I know a few users who had it done at Stanford and either got a complication or their sleep apnea didn't improve (due to insufficient advancement), they have one of the worst track records in the community. One of the challenges is often the better surgeons are more $ or require better insurance, generally we really like Alfaro, Wolford, Kasey Li, LACOMS, or Steinbacher (in that order).\n\nI would recommend joining the r/UARSnew discord server, there are a lot of people like you interested in sleep apnea surgeries mostly because either CPAP is not effective or cannot be tolerated.

With DOME, I would have surgery and then be in braces for the next year or two to align teeth after expansion.

i595tl8,u6idas,"I'll explain the difference between expansion techniques, might help.\n\nThe goal of maxillary expansion for the treatment of OSA is twofold:\n\n* Expand the nasal aperture (nasomaxillary expansion) to improve nasal breathing and decrease negative pressure upon inspiration.\n* Expand the posterior maxilla (parallel expansion pattern) to expand the nasopharynx and increase muscle tension to resist collapse.\n\nEASE does both of these things, since there is no LeFort 1 and there is parallel expansion due to the posterior cuts to the pterygomaxillary sutures and the type of expander is able to overcome the resistance.\n\nDOME can be done a variety of ways. Typically with Stanford they use a MARPE along with what they describe as a partial LeFort (which I assume is some scoring of the nasal and zygomatic buttresses, common with ""DOME""). Some people in the community asked them to do posterior cuts as well, but I'm not sure if they added that to their protocol or just did it upon request. If you do a partial LeFort then you do not have nasal aperture expansion, and if you don't do posterior cuts then you will get significantly less posterior expansion on average.\n\nIdeally with DOME you want to use an MSE, do the buttress scoring but also do the posterior cuts to achieve a lot of posterior expansion. You may not expand the nasal aperture very well but at least you'll get the posterior expansion.",1650314077,t1_i593ixr,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u6idas/mild_sleep_apnea_dome_mma_recommended_looking_for/i595tl8/

You might talk to your doctor (or DIY) about raising the starting pressure closer to the pressure your machine settles to, it's called your 90% or 95% pressure, if you are comfortable opening up clinical settings, that's likely what you should be using when you are reading/watching tv getting used to your mask better.\n\nWhen you get everything dialed in, and yourself trained up for it (two feet thing is what helped me the most, it's sooooo important) you'll struggle to sleep without the machine, it gets better.\n\nIf all of the above doesn't help, consider posting to cpaptalk.com or apneaboards with the recommended information from OSCAR.\n\nIt sounds like you've got the patience down pat, now you need some determination.

i52kl3i,u5jbuy,"Your pressures might be wrong, and you're likely using the wrong machine. I hate to say it, but most doctors never follow up to ensure that your pressures are both effective and comfortable.

Honestly, those people there were SO KIND and extremely knowledgeable. It turns out, my pressure was like 3x what I really needed, and I'm much happier with a bipap (because trying to exhale through the pressure was not working for me), which I bought off of Craigslist for like $400, and adjusted my settings myself (with the help of the apneaboard people and OSCAR). Now my AHI is like 0.0-0.3 every night, and I'm super comfortable.\n\nI also fired my doctor. \n\nI recently went to a new doctor at a respiratory hospital and she congratulated me on working with the pressures myself. She added, ""I don't know why people worry so much about adjusting things themselves. It's just air.""\n\nAnyway, try working things through yourself with the help of the people at apneaboard.com.

I had a catheter before for dialysis and that was obviously there all day but I'd still scratch it at night.  \n\nOne thing is to make sure the mask has a good fit.

i565uvs,u5jbuy,"I feel you. \n\nI tried on and off for 7 years. I finally decided on surgery, and I still have people telling me it just takes dedication etc. \n\nThough, to be honest, keep it up! You are doing well, and much of the advice here and other forums is invaluable. \n\nSome tips from a failed (but experienced) CPAP user:\n\n1) Habituation therapy is very helpful. This involves using it (or just wearing it) while awake. E.g., while watching TV in the evening. This helps condition your brain to accept it. \n\n2) Washing your face every night before bed helps immensely with leaks. This is also true for cleaning the mask daily. Washing the oil away helps make a much more secure send comfortable seal.\n\n3) Dry mouth, insufflation, and most discomfort is caused by leaks! It never occurred to my sleep doc that my complaints were being caused by leaks (duh!). It wasn't until I got advice online that I realized I was having leaks every night. \n\n4) Long ramp periods can be very helpful for helping you fall asleep. Similarly using APAP with low starting pressure can also be helpful. \n\n5) Napping is not allowed! It doesn't matter if you couldn't sleep all night because you were struggling with your CPAP. Napping, particularly after 12 noon, will significantly alter your bed routine. If you have trouble falling asleep because you napped, then you will likeky sit awake with your CPAP, until you eventually fall asleep... without the mask on.\n\n6) This one only applies to people who live with their significant other, and even then maybe was unique just to me: The only extended period when I was successful with CPAP was when I had a bed partner. I think this helped for two reasons: First I was self-conscious of falling asleep without the mask because my snoring would disturb my gf. Second, I think this also applied to taking my mask off and leaving it running. When not sleeping with a bed partner, I would often wake up in the morning with mask off and the machine hissing air - without remembering ever taking it off. I think that having a bed partner would make me more conscious of the hissing sounds, and I would instinctively wake up, readjust the mask, and go back to sleep. Maybe I should move in with my GF so I can try this again! Lol.",1650255669,t3_u5jbuy,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u5jbuy/bad_cpap_experience/i565uvs/

So, I regularly take Vitamin D along with vitamin K.\n \nSecondly, the factor that probably caused that is the physiology of your tongue that sits on the back of your airway while sleeping. You should research on tongue exercisea on youtube and do that exercises regularly to have significant results.

Some people are much more sensitive to mask leaks than others (like myself). So managing mask leaks can sometimes be the difference between great and bad sleep.\n\nI have two possible solutions:\n\n1. The nasal pillows aren't a good fit for your nose. You need to try a different mask or mask size.\n2. Even though you go to sleep with a good mask seal, it may not hold well when the pressure starts ramping up. Try tightening your mask straps, or try CPAP mode. Trying CPAP mode might help because it is kept at a constant pressure.

By the third night, it‚Äôs gotten tolerable.  And, after that, the mask is awesome.  [In a month (or so), I toss it, and start over.]\n\nSimilarly, when I get new headgear, I have the same break-in period due to strap-stretching.  My pressure is 14-18, and the straps have quite a job to maintain that seal evenly all night.  For the first couple of nights, what feels ‚Äúright‚Äù when I go to bed is _never_ right in the wee hours of the morning.  Eventually, they hold steady all night, I find the right tension, and all is good.\n\nOverall, the F20 is terrific (even with my facial hair), but needs a few days of settling-in.\n\n‚Äî\n\nAs for dry mouth:  I also had this problem.  I added a foam collar that fits comfortably-and-loose (too tight makes me feel like I‚Äôm being strangled).  The foam under my chin does a reasonable job of supporting my jaw when I‚Äôm deeply asleep‚Ä¶ which cuts _way_ down on mouth breathing.

It‚Äôs also easier to see the time and the machine without something strapped to your face. \n\nWhat I realized from videotaping myself (with a cheap night vision security cam from Amazon) was that I was waking up several times in the night, taking off the mask to check the machine, then seeing it wasn‚Äôt time to get up, and then falling back asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow and I was forgetting to put the mask back on and not remembering any of the awakenings in the morning.

I also started checking the machine and the time with my mask on. I also taped the mask to the hose because sometimes I was waking up with the mask on but disconnected from the house.

i51oham,u4zb5s,"I'm not a fan of CPAP, and it is definitely possible to continue with symptoms even while using it regularly. However, make sure to get off benadryl before looking further into the issue. \n\nIf the symptoms persist after being off sleeping pills for a month or more (and you're using CPAP regularly), then you can look into three types of diagnosis:\n\n1) Some patients continue experiencing significant disordered breathing -related disruptions even with CPAP. This isn't too uncommon, but it is uncommon for symptoms of sleep disordered breathing to completely persist when sleeping well with CPAP. A sleep doc can help determine this for you, and people here can help interpret PSG data/CPAP data. Sometimes the solution can be PAP settings or special PAP machines e.g., bipap. Alternatively, ENTs can offer surgical solutions.\n\n2) Other times this could be caused by an underlying medical condition e.g., hypothyroidism or other hormonal issues. Your sleep doc and GP can both help run tests to start excluding medical conditions. Also, I'm sure people here can provide exhaustive lists of possible conditions - albeit many of these are uncommon/unlikely diagnoses. \n\n3) Idiopathic hypersomnia + ADHD or ""we don't know why you're tired/fogged"" is another diagnosis. Although this diagnosis seems supremely unhelpful, it does open up treatment options that can help manage your symptoms. If this is ultimately your diagnosis, then your symptoms are likely lifelong, but there are many drugs beyond amphetamines that you can try. \n\nWith all of that being said, I think getting off sleeping pills (completely) and good CPAP aggressive is likely to resolve your symptoms. However, it many people struggle to sleep well while using CPAP. CPAP intolerance is very common. Other OSA treatments are available, but first things first.",1650170625,t3_u4zb5s,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u4zb5s/my_sleep_cpap_machine_is_worthless_it_does/i51oham/
i51yi82,u4zb5s,">I am so tired of being TIRED 24/7 and not having the energy to do ANYTHING at all. I can barely even drive without constantly dozing off. I can‚Äôt live like this anymore and been using sleep cpap for months with no effect.\n\nWhat did your sleep test results say?\n\nWhat AHI does your machine report you have now?\n\nOn what basis do you say it's ""worthless""?\n\nSleep apnea has side effects like impotence, heart attack, stroke, and death. The point of a CPAP is not to make you feel good - although that is a common side effect of CPAP treatment - it's to help ensure you don't die from sleep apnea. If you are using it and you're not feeling better, one of several things is happening:\n\n1. You could be successfully treating the sleep apnea, and also have an additional problem that is making you feel tired. If this is the case, you need to talk to your doctor about it, but you also need to keep using the CPAP to make sure you don't die.\n2. Do you actually have sleep apnea? That is why I asked about the results of your sleep test.\n3. Depending on the type of sleep apnea you have, the CPAP may or may not be the right kind of machine to treat it. Unfortunately, for folks who have central sleep apnea, some insurance companies require them to get the kind of CPAP that won't work for that and show that it fails first, because it's cheaper and a lot of people will just give up and go away before they get the machine they really need. \n4. Maybe you're not having successful treatment. That's why I asked what AHI the machine reports you have now. If this is the case, usually something simple can be tweaked to fix the problem, like better fit of the mask, or a different mask, or a chin strap, or turning up or down the humidifier, or turning up or down the pressure. \n5. Other - if none of the above turn out to be the case, we will ask you a lot of questions, and to look at your data, to try to help you figure it out. \n\nAlso lemmie be blunt - your post doesn't ask for any help, you're just complaining. If you want help, we'll try to help you, but you've got to calm down and work with us.

i5400p8,u4koos,"Since you are here on reddit, you are probably tech savvy enough and interested in forums enough to do the homework on this.  Pick one of the two main forums at https://www.cpaptalk.com/CPAP-Sleep-Apnea-Forum.html or http://www.apneaboard.com/forums/index.php (they are sorta duplicative but I've found good info on both) and read the thread on setting up and using OSCAR (Oscar is a currently supported fork of Sleepyhead if you see references to Sleepyhead).  You can read your data to learn about your events and optimizing your pressure.  While the AirSense does auto adjust some, there is likely more optimization you can do.  Also you can see what types of events your cpap is registering and that may help.  \n\nIf you like tools and data you might also consider a pulseox that will save your data...if you see your SPO2 getting low you can confirm for yourself that hypoxemia is or is not a likely source of the headaches.  It was worth the money to me to get the pulseox and be able to sync the data in oscar with my cpap data. Not all SPO2 work with Oscar so do the hw before buying.\n\nMost sleep/pulmonary Drs don't do a lot for follow up and optimization for your machine settings unless you are having problems and it is a hassle to make an appointment to go see the doc.  Fine tune your treatment so that you are getting the best results for you.\n\nUltimately you may need a machine that delivers higher pressures or has a greater delta between the high and low pressures than the Airsense provides.\n\nI would just use the Average events reported by the cpap and not do the math for total events.  I would also add sleep hours as a possible cause, simply not getting enough sleep can cause headaches. 2-4 events/hour may not sound high compared to some of the studies, but it still may be too high for you.\n\nFor me (and other on those forums), anything over 2 events an hour really affects restful sleep, despite what the clinical data says.  Listen to your body :)  I'd focus on getting those events down by experimenting with pressure, mask positioning, or the type of mask you use.  I use DIY extra straps I added to mine for a more secure fit and less seal breaking/leakage while sleeping, no sewing, just tying on some elastic cord or strap to my existing mask. Some folks use a chinstrap to keep their mouth shut or even medical tape over their lips to keep them shut.  Also test your tubing to make sure it hasn't developed holes and leaks, I simply fill detach my tubing from my machine and mask, will it with water in the shower, and plug one end with my thumb, and then blow into the other end to create a slight amount of positive pressure and look for leaks.\n\nIf all the homework is intimidating, just use the # of events as your guide and experiment with the changes I listed other than the pressure.   The nice part about getting the data with Oscar is analyzing your minimum pressure so you can set it properly on the airsense and also understanding the types of events you are having.",1650219770,t1_i4yemki,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u4koos/morning_headaches_last_until_evening_then_get/i5400p8/

And after a friend of mine had a heart attack out of no where (and he was in much better shape than I am) it made me really worried about that potential. \n\nUltimately they couldn't find anything actually wrong in EKGs or any of the other tests, and my GP when I had my annual a few weeks after all of that said that he thought what had happened was basically that my lungs weren't used to breathing that much air, and were  getting a full workout each night while I slept and after a while something got strained in my chest wall. \n\nI asked if I should get any other tests done just to be sure and his feedback was basically outside my weight I didn't have any high risk factors, it had been lasting for a while and all the other tests (ekg, x-ray, blood work, etc) had come back normal every time, and that I was more likely to end up with an eventual false positive of something being wrong that wasn't than I was to have an issue, so wait a bit longer and if it gets worse or doesn't go away come back. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks it did stop and I haven't really had any chest discomfort since then, so I imagine he was right.",1650006793,t3_u400nm,/r/SleepApnea/comments/u400nm/new_to_cpap_chest_pain_and_weird_breathing/i4szq44/

Nostril to nostril is also needed but not as effective.\n\n2)  With no delay, connect that cpap and crank up the pressure to 15/20. Tilt your head back, forward, back forward.
