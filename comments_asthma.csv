i6n3oco,ue6m6i,"Usually if you don't have symptoms while someone is listening to your breathing (with or without a stethoscope) asthma cannot be heard.\n\nTo diagnose asthma you have to do a lung function test (blow into a machine that measures how much and how fast you can expel air from your lungs). Sometimes this is done inside a small closed chamber (looks like a phone booth) to also measure the pressure change during your breathing (this would be called bodyphletismography). \n\nAs I mentioned, with asthma your lung function can be completely normal outside a flare up, which is why they would sometimes try to trigger a mild ""attack"" (in a controlled setting) by either giving you medicine to breathe (usually methacholine) that irritates the lungs or having you exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike (if it is exercise induced). \n\nAsthma would usually be diagnosed if either your lung function is abnormal (reduced) to begin with and improves after you are given an inhaler or if you react to the methacholine or exercise challenge with a reduction in lung function.",1651219443,t3_ue6m6i,/r/Asthma/comments/ue6m6i/quick_questions_about_effort_induced_asthma/i6n3oco/

i6kzrqh,ue3nn6,"Is this a liquid? I assumed it was but then the other commenters said something about crushed pills.\n\nBoth of my kids had to take liquid prevacid from infancy for a pretty severe reflux. We had to try a couple medications before we finally found what worked but they would also be willing to take. Through that process I found out that you can talk to the pharmacist about having a flavor potentially added to the medication. Fruit punch or grape might work and make it a little more palatable? You may also want to speak to a compound pharmacy to see if they can make your medicine as that might be a way of having it done without whatever is giving it the nasty taste, if it's not a necessary ingredient. For instance we found out that some medications come pre-flavored.\n\nHow are you administering the medication? Cup, medication spoon, medicine dropper / syringe? If you're using a syringe like [this style](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ2HMJ7/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_YGWV0N8BFD2E5FA9166T?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)(the pharmacist will give you free ones), it can take some maneuvering but they work best if you can squeeze out the liquid on the side of the mouth as far to the back of the tongue as you can get, and fast!, like where the molars would be. With practice, trust and patience you can even let your little one depress the syringe themselves. Having that control over it might help them be less defined about taking it. My oldest was never into that but my youngest would grab the syringe out of my hand and give himself his medicine somewhere around a year old. All kids are different so it's just a thought not a guarantee.\n\nAlso, bribing. Does your little one like chocolate? Here have a chug of milk and an Oreo cookie or a Hershey's kiss when you take your medicine. It's not something that you would have to do forever, just until they come to realize taking it isn't really the end of the world. Even now my oldest is 9 years old and she hates taking amoxicillin. I mean she has a huge anxiety attack when she thinks she's getting amoxicillin. So every time she takes it I let her have a big gulp of milk to wash the flavor out and then a cookie, kinder bueno, Hershey's kiss, some kind of little treat as a reward for being brave.",1651179660,t3_ue3nn6,/r/Asthma/comments/ue3nn6/tips_to_get_a_2_year_old_to_take_oral_prednisolone/i6kzrqh/

Totally independent. That‚Äôs mostly fatigue and brain fog. In terms of my lungs, I have ground glass opacities in both lungs and both of my lower lobes collapsed. My case is different because I wasn‚Äôt even admitted to the hospital and this was before anyone knew anything at all about what was going on. I got no treatment and the ER sent me home thinking I‚Äôd get better (I didn‚Äôt). At least now, there is enough data out there to where you can get better care than I did.\n\nAnd the lung damage does not last forever earlier. My lungs are slowly getting better. I go for walks as often as I can. I‚Äôm working on building up my endurance so I can walk more. Every appointment with my pulmonologist shows more progress and that‚Äôs saying something considering I didn‚Äôt get any kind of help until 18 months after I had Covid.\n\nSorry for the rant!\n\nTl;dr: my lungs are messed up from Covid but it‚Äôs from a lack of treatment.

Before I had covid for the first time I already had mild exercise induced asthma, but nothing more than that.\n\nThe first time I had fever for a few days and a really annoying cough for a couple weeks afterwards, but apart from that I was fine.\n\nThe second time (I was vaccinated 3x by then) started really mild, I had bit of a fever for a day, and then a runny nose on the second day and on the third I was perfectly fine. But on the fourth day I started to have a really hard time breathing and once constantly short of breath to the point where I had to sleep sitting up and my vision would go black every time I stood up. I expected it to go away after a few days, but it didn't, so I went to see a pulmonologist.

I even attempt it and I would want to pass out. It caused SO many issues that went well beyond just my lungs. \n\nI have since had 3 vaccinations. \n\nI got it again at the beginning of April. I was sick. Very very sick. I wear a watch that lets me track my pulse ox and it hasn‚Äôt come above 93% since I got sick. My doctors have been trying everything to help my lungs. I am slowly getting better. Very very slowly. The cough left after 5 days but it comes and goes now. The shortness of breath is chronic. The tightness is always there. Body aches galore. \n\nThe exhaustion is the worst. Absolutely horrid. It‚Äôs also messed up my relationship with my ADHD meds lmao. Seriously. \n\nThe worst of it is the brain fog. It was bad after the first time around but this time? It‚Äôs horrible. I hate it. I‚Äôm 35. Went back to school. I went from deans list with 90% average to getting my first 70% as a final great.

i6d1s2b,uctepi,"Asthma can present in quite different ways, especially in kids. Obvs none of us can give actual medical advice and the only people who can are your child's doctors. With the disclaimer stated, what are her symptoms like? Particularly on a daily basis, cos you've only mentioned the emergencies.\n\nThe fact you mentioned croup is interesting - the wheezing typical of asthma actually sounds quite different from other wheezing to those who are trained in what to look for (something I never got the hang of when I was studying medicine). There's rales, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing, or at least those were the 4 most common types of abnormal sound we were always trying to distinguish between; it also matters whether the sound is on the inhale or the exhale or both, and how loud it is. So the fact that the drs have presumably listened to her breathing a number of times, hopefully both when she's not having an attack and when she is, is reassuring that they're likely on the right track, as the kind of sound can tell you a lot about what might be causing the issues.\n\nAnother important thing is simply whether the breathing difficulties respond to a rescue inhaler. Asthma causes the airways in the lungs to swell and construct, and then rescue inhalers cause them to open up again. If there's another kind of obstruction to breathing, the rescue inhaler won't do nearly as much (it usually still helps a bit to be fair, but if the airways are already open there's only so much you can achieve by telling them to open more). There are reasons asthmatics might not respond to specific rescue inhalers well, but it's a strong indicator of asthma if the breathing difficulties respond to one\n\nIt also takes a good while for any preventative treatment to start working, and most people need to spend a while adjusting dosages or trying different things, so don't be disheartened by that. Just make sure to keep on top of it! Inhaler technique is also really important if you have any inhaled medicine, you should be using a spacer, ideally one with a mask that covers her nose as well as her mouth. I'm sure they've covered it but don't hesitate to ask for help from your drs on inhaler and spacer technique or just reassurance that you and your child are doing it right",1651033730,t3_uctepi,/r/Asthma/comments/uctepi/need_advice_from_the_asthma_experts_newish_asthma/i6d1s2b/

i6hxfjm,uctepi,"All I can really offer is my experience. Although I wasn't diagnosed until I started getting really sick in my early teens, I always had an issue with exercise and any slight sickness knocked me out for a week, simply because of the cough. I didn't present the typical symptoms - rarely any wheezing, short of breath but normal O2 stats, and although I had a lot of mucus in my throat whenever my allergies flared up or I exercised, it was seen as regular allergies.\n\nI'd use my brother's inhalers when I was sick because that or steroids were the only things that relieved my cough. Then, when I was 13, I caught whooping cough. My parents didn't know the immunization for pertussis wore off after 10 years, and because most kids get it and don't even notice, my pediatrician had no reason to think it would hit me any different. After three ER visits and a handful of pediatrician visits, I got in with a pulmonologist and got a lung function test and blood tests done for typical asthma markers.\n\nI forget what the marker was, but it was slightly elevated in my blood work, just outside the normal range. My lung function tests and all other typical asthma markers were not indicating anything, but that combined with the symptoms I'd always had led to a diagnosis of cough variant asthma. Although my parents didn't pursue any treatment at the time because it wasn't causing my symptoms, we did end up getting treatment because my lungs were damaged from the whooping cough (which worsened my originally mild asthma).\n\nMy mom felt the same way you did whenever I was in an attack. And while I was old enough to put up a brave face and tell her I was alright for a few days, she still knew I was miserable. I think the best thing you can do is just distract her. I was never into coloring that much, but I remember my mom and I would color for hours while I was in an attack. I didn't forget about what was happening, but it calmed me down some. That and Legos were my best friend during those attacks lol.\n\nBest of luck to you and your kiddo, I hope you find the right treatment soon!",1651121529,t3_uctepi,/r/Asthma/comments/uctepi/need_advice_from_the_asthma_experts_newish_asthma/i6hxfjm/

It's like they think I'm going to drop dead in a minute or something when in reality it's just because I overexerted myself and don't want to wait two hours for the tightness/shortness of breath to go away. \n\nI've luckily never had to do a neb treatment in public before, mostly because when I need them I'm too sick to even leave the house unless it's for a doctor appointment. My rescue works most of the time unless I'm actively in an attack, which seems pretty backwards, but as long as I avoid triggers or use my rescue as a preventative measure, I'm alright. Now, whenever I get sick, it goes straight to my lungs and turns into bronchitis or pnuemonia most of the time, and then I'm doing neb treatments every 3-4 hours (with doctor approval). But like I said, if I'm that sick, no way I'm leaving the house for anything other than healthcare.\n\nThere was one time when I went to get a chest x-ray while I was in an attack and this lady was all pissy with me because I was coughing. I sat away from anyone else, then she sat next to me, said ""someone should've stayed home"", moved across the room, and continued to bitch about me until my mom told me to wait outside so she'd shut the hell up.

I changed diet, took some PPIs and I feel better. The improvement wasnt immediate. I thought nothing and nobody is going to help me, so dont give up.\n\nDo u have mucus in your throat?

Ignore what they say now after four years of them getting it all wrong - where I could barely function or go out or lay down or do anything because of the constant wheezing, cough and shortness of breath which they never really helped with or even understood.

I added turmeric powder to my diet, I've cut down processed meat. I started sleeping with my head elevated and don't eat before bedtime. These changes may not help you immediately or even at all dependant on how bad you've got it though. I think you could benefit from an endoscopy, that would clear things up. I'm quite positive you're dealing with at least some degree of what I was experiencing though, it sounds similar. You may have h. pylori as well. Typically it's not linked to breathlessness, but people on hpylori subreddit get this issue very often as well, so there is definite link between the two. Maybe try some OTC PPIs as well, could help, but if it doesn't don't give up, it doesn't necessarily have to make a difference. I'd suggest the endoscopy to be sure.\n\nWhat can help you as well, is to control your breath. Think of it that way: your lungs are getting enough air in, but you're getting a false signal that forces you to get more in regardless, which causes you to try get more in, even though your lungs don't want any more, causing inability to catch a full breath. It's not entirely controllable, but once you try to control your breath to not look for those deep breaths and hold your breath instead - it may help. I try to keep a steady, slow pace of breathing without gasps and allow my body to return to its normal rhythm of breathing. It won't always work, but it can help as well. There's a learning curve to this. Even though it may feel uncontrollable, it can make a difference long term if you just try to control the rhythm and hold your breath when you're overreaching for breath. You can't suffocate from holding your breath, it's impossible.",1650918461,t1_i66clcy,/r/Asthma/comments/ubdeww/what_in_the_world_is_happening_to_me/i66dh8a/

i61lk2w,ub2rnw,"first off the part I don't understand is 'significant air trapping' and 'non obstructive spirometry' because isn't the first one due to the second one? \n\nI'd recommend a long acting bronchodialator. I use Anoro but there are many on the market. You might also benefit from from Combivent in your nebulizer on a daily routine and use albuterol for attacks. Combivent is a combination of Albuterol and Iputropium Bromide and they both act in different ways to open the airways. Googled ""[pursed lip breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWPtSzs6yUk)"" because I can't describe it here beyond it's like slowly blowing out a candle. What it does is it creates a negative back pressure keeping the airways open longer during exhalation resulting in less air trapping. This is particularly useful to pace yourself with this way of breathing during physical activity or to recovery from physical activity. There is also something called lung reduction surgery that can provide relief depending on if that's your situation or not. \n\nTo explain the spirometry I think the air trapping is evident between these values TLC 106% predicted and Residual Volume 162% predicted. The TLC includes the RV. \n\nI hope you feel better soon. I think given your medications there is room to improve your breathing with an adjustment or two.

I am asthmatic (got officially diagnosed twice even by different pulmos after unambiguous test results). Yet I hardly ever wheeze, my oximeter readings stay normal even during attacks (and as an ER doc told me, that's not unusual for asthmatics, which is why a normal oximeter reading should never be used to rule out an asthma attack), and my untriggered pulmonary function tests have always come back normal as well (add to that that my untriggered lung volume is like 140% of what is considered ""normal"" for my weight and height).\n\nYour doctor is dismissing your symptoms as ""not asthma"" without running the tests necessary to be sure (in my case, the first diagnosis was after triggering my exercise-induced asthma before pulmonary function test, and the second diagnosis was with a metacholin trigger test, which is basically a series of pulmonary function tests while inhalting an irritant in between). You could still have asthma! So I strongly suggest getting a second opinion and asking them to run the necessary tests (pulmonary function test, if that doesn't show asthma, a metacholin trigger test).\n\nDid you at least also get a rescue inhaler prescribed (salbutamol is the most common one), or only the steroids?",1650651273,t1_i5rhe12,/r/Asthma/comments/u985qj/anyone_awake_to_walk_me_through_what_to_do_if_i/i5s2utj/

i5nzfi1,u8szep,"Yes.  They absolutely work.  But the thing is, it's a different experience and you need to calibrate your expectations accordingly.\n\nWhen you use an inhaler with a spacer, you're allowing the medicine to mix with the air in the chamber, and you're inhaling that air.  It's akin to a nebulizer - the mix of air and medicine is much more homogenous, so it can go deeper into your lungs/bronchial tubes and you'll get a more thorough, distributed dose.  But it's also a *weaker* dose, per each breath you take.  I usually take 3-4 deep breaths from the spacer, and the effect comes on more gradually.\n\nWhen you use an inhaler without a spacer, you're basically shooting a concentrated burst of the medicine straight into your tonsils or the back of your throat.  What you inhale is much more concentrated than with a spacer.  So it's going to feel different.  If you're relying on your rescue inhaler for immediate alleviation of symptoms, this method will likely ""feel better"" because you're getting that highly concentrated dose in an immediate fashion.\n\nObviously I'm not a doctor, let alone your doctor, but it sounds like your asthma is not very well controlled at the moment if you're relying on the quick onset feeling of the rescue inhaler and you're mentioning that you aren't able to take deep breaths.  So it makes sense that you don't enjoy the spacer - you need that concentrated shot of albuterol!  \n\nTalk to your doctor about controller/maintenance meds, and absolutely use a spacer with those.  There's no quick/concentrated benefit, so you're just giving yourself a better, more distributed dose by using a spacer.  \n\nGood luck!",1650574430,t3_u8szep,/r/Asthma/comments/u8szep/do_spacers_actually_work/i5nzfi1/

Only diagnosed with allergic asthma last week. theres a big overlap in symptoms for me and I think that's (one) part of why the asthma diagnosis took so long. I rarely get obvious acid up the back of my throat, so for me the GERD is mainly my chest aching or feeling pressure. I swear it's the same feeling as when I am reacting to pollen and having trouble breathing and my chest starts aching. I also have anxiety which I guess triggers either the GERD or the asthma? Because same thing. Chest pressure. My GERD doesn't cause me trouble breathing, but sometimes the pollen is not bad for me to \*notice\* I'm not breathing well and all I feel is an ache in my chest. So yeah, it's very confusing.   \n\n\nI have been to a lot of cardiologists by the way, just to be clear. Especially since sometimes the chest pressure radiates down my arms (!!!). Heart is fine. But better safe than sorry.   \n\n\nI've since read there is a connection.

I also consider if I ate something that would be bothering me or if I‚Äôm in a new, especially dusty or irritating environment / somewhere with poor air quality to help pinpoint whether it is GI or asthma shortness of breath.

I take an antihistamine pill daily (having to double it from time to time, for example right now during high pollen counts in spring), mast cell stabilising eyedrops twice daily (can be increased to four times daily if needed), and localised antihistamine eyedrops and nose spray as needed. Those meds help suppress allergy symptoms (of which my asthma is one) but aren't a cure-all. High allergy exposure will still cause symptoms up to asthma attacks.\n\nFor my asthma, I take an inhaled corticosteroid as my base medication (which keeps the inflammation down to reduce asthma symptoms overall, not just those from allergic asthma, as I have both allergic and non-allergic triggers). It brings my asthma baseline down enough that I don't need to use my rescue inhaler too often, but trigger exposure is still always a risk factor (and the more triggers are present, the higher the likelihood of an asthma attack).\n\nSo while I don't get random asthma attacks from reading a letter, generally (though the magazine of my allergy and asthma club, ironically, is bad enough that I can only hold it at arm's length, very carefully, before throwing it into the trash), I try to have as little paper around me as possible because too much can still definitely trigger problems.

That has been the only way of successfully treating my asthma.

They run around $30 and it is great investment for peace of mind. As long as your pulse ox is staying above 94, you are getting enough oxygen in your blood. Anything below that means you should be seeking additional medical help. \n\nUnfortunately it is normal to feel like crap after long nebs, mag and IV steroids. Your body is extra exhausted from working so hard to breathe and yet all those meds mean it's hard to get the sleep you need because they Amp you up. The good news is that they should help you feel better soon (next couple days).

However, this is based on my experience only, your future could well be different.\n\nYou say having a smoke can help instead of your inhaler. No, it doesn't. What does help is slower, deeper, more controlled breathing - which just so happens to be what you do when smoking. You would achieve the same results without a cigarette - to be honest, I used to think the same until I realised it was a lie to myself.\n\nYou ask if replacing cigarettes with cigars would be better. Well, yes and no but relatively better as the smoke isn't going direct into the lungs. But secondhand smoke (is it really secondhand if you made it?) is still going to be breathed in. That said, good luck being a cigarette smoker and not inhaling... I know I find it almost impossible. You want / need that hit!\n\nHas it made my asthma worse? I honestly don't know... my asthma was really bad when I was a kid, as an adult its alrightish mostly. So, on the one hand, I started smoking and it improved... but that is also fools logic. Would it be even better if I hadn't started? Yeah, probably.\n\nWhat about long term health conditions?  I can see in certain areas that smoking has caused damage but ironically not my lungs. Yet, anyway. But what really scares me now is how would I know? I get breathless... it's my asthma. I cough... asthma. I have the inhalers, I feel better, but I could just be masking a much more serious problem without realising and nobody will know until it's way too late.\n\nWe all know the risks although at 20 do we really appreciate them? No, I certainly didn't. We think of time very differently when young compared to older... let me try to explain, but honestly I wouldn't have got this at your age...\n\nLife expectancy varies around the world, economic background etc, but given that I smoke getting to 70 might be reasonable. I may get luckier, I might be unlucky. But that gives me 20 years or thereabouts. The pension age here in the UK is currently 67, and likely to rise over the coming years so I'll get 3 years to ""enjoy my retirement"". I might be around to see my grandkids graduate uni. At the age I am now, 20 years I know is a long time but I'm also very aware it's not that long. It'll be past in two blinks of the eye and that is.... yeah, not great!\n\nWhen you're 20 you think you're invincible and it won't happen to you, and 20 years in the future is quite literally an entire lifetime away. So let's do a little mind experiment to try and give you a sense of how perspective and the choice we make change...\n\nImagine if I told you, with 100% certainty, that if you carry on smoking now you will be dead before 30. I'm not saying when, it could be 21, 25 or 29. But if you carry on you will not see your 30th birthday.\n\nWould you choose to carry on?\n\nOf  course it isn't going to that quickly in reality but from a time span perspective that it how it feels to me today. \n\nWhich leads me to the final point - Why on earth do I carry on?\n\nIt is stupidly, ridiculously, addictive. I must have experimented with every illegal substance available at one point or other in my youth (rock n roll... what can I say?). I only ended up addicted to 1...  make of that what you will.\n\nI used to say I'll give up when I'm 30... and couldn't\n\nThen I said, I'll give up when I'm 40... and couldn't. And, it wasn't for lack of trying either!\n\nAnd now, I'm going to give up when I'm 50. It feels like it's that or die.... and I'm not ready to die.\n\nWill I succeed? I dont know... I intend to but I know how hard it is to do and dying might just be easier to manage.\n\nBut you... well... it's early days for you. Quitting would still be tough, but the longer you smoke for the tougher it gets.\n\nI said no judgement but I lied... here's my final thought and yeah, maybe it's judgmental but I think it's the honest truth.\n\nI don't blame any young person for experimenting and trying new things - it would be weird if you didn't! Nor do I for making mistakes... hell, I made enough! But to carry on smoking, when in full possession of the facts is just madness... basically, a long drawn out suicide.\n\nBut, you make your own choices and decision :)",1649865632,t3_u2s5in,/r/Asthma/comments/u2s5in/tobacco_smoking_as_an_asthmatic_what_can_i_expect/i4kw9r9/

i4k8ler,u28l67,"Pedialyte good for electrolyte re-uptake.  You will burn loads of calories, so hydrate & replenish your salts, which help water absorption.  Gatorade works as well.  You can find non-brand specific tablets at the store or online as well.  The more you stay hydrated, the less you‚Äôll notice the crazy side effects. If you notice moodiness or strong urges, it might not be a bad idea to keep a journal to help put you into a reflective thought mode and that will help you with your unconscious responses in the every day (as well keep one occupied). Ask people close to you to help give you some feedback if you seem like you are responding unusually to circumstance or seem, ‚Äúout of character,‚Äù if you get concerned that the medication is affecting your relationships. All of those things will help you to curb some of the side effects that are quite real for some people, but a lot of that is an interior mental apperception that is only noticeable when you unload it aloud to the other.  Let me rephrase that last bit, it doesn‚Äôt mean that those things aren‚Äôt actually happening by saying it‚Äôs a mental state, just be aware that if you spend a lot of time in your mood it‚Äôs like a pressure cooker with the steroidal compounds, especially if they are not something you take regularly, also (& a Big also) if you‚Äôre high energy/ functioning by default‚Äîbronchodilators allow you to get more oxygen to your brain, therefore you process faster on top of the adrenal reactions happening due to the medicine.  If you have been in a low energy state due to illness or oxygen deprivation and then suddenly shift gears into faster mental processing, it can quickly overwhelm anyone; conservation of energy-it must go somewhere.  In my case, and I don‚Äôt mean to dwell so I‚Äôm just offering a quick example, I have taken albuterol and other corticosteroids pretty much my whole life and none of them have any noticeable effects in the way I hear others report, insofar as side effects.  I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a personal experience, so just trust the people you know you can and keep yourself in the mind of you are on drugs when you‚Äôre taking this medication and therefore you might notice some oddities in your thoughts and behaviors so you can usually check your mood by reminding yourself that oh yeah there‚Äôs this variable involved, & a lot of times it‚Äôs a simple as that to curb the mood swing",1649856016,t3_u28l67,/r/Asthma/comments/u28l67/prednisolone/i4k8ler/

i4h9q97,u2636o,"No, this is not normal, especially if it's a very strong need.  Some of us (cough, me, cough) use our rescue inhalers more often than we should as a ""comfort"" thing, because we've been using them for literally decades.  They turn into security blankets (dunno if that's an idiom that will translate).  But I haven't actually had a full-blown asthma attack that would've put me into the ER in many years.  For reference, I'm 37 and I've had asthma my entire life.\n\nIf you're actually so short of breath that you're having asthma attacks and you're relying on your rescue inhaler to keep that from happening, you need to revisit your preventative/maintenance medication.  Either what you're on isn't working for you, or the dose is too low, or something. \n\nIt took me 3-4 attempts at different medications (flovent, serevent, etc) to finally land on what works for me (asmanex), and I go through different phases with my asthma.  Seasonal allergies tie into it.  My weight and overall health tie into it.  Asthma is a very ""fuzzy"" disease in that it can really wax and wane and so many different aspects can affect it. \n\nTalk to your boyfriend and talk to your doctor.  Maybe write out your symptoms and how it feels in very plain language so it's easier to translate, and do it ahead of time so you aren't trying to translate on the fly. \n\nSomething that's also useful is keeping a journal of your symptoms.  Write down what you feel and when and how often you're using your inhaler.  That's the kind of hard data that doctors like because it very clearly indicates a pattern. \n\nDo you have a peak flow meter?  You should get one.  They're very cheap and simple and widely available.  There's a strong possibility you can get one in whatever country you're in.  It translates your respiratory function into a simple number, and again, it's best when you graph it over time. \n\nIf I'm diligent with my peak flow readings, I can predict when I'm about to get sick before I feel any symptoms, just because my peak flow will go down.  (I haven't been that diligent since I was a teenager and my parents made me do it, but still, it works)",1649796862,t3_u2636o,/r/Asthma/comments/u2636o/using_rescue_inhaler_every_day/i4h9q97/

i4dqkfr,u1ib8x,"So I would recommend taking a daily antihistamine because even though if you aren't actively sneezing or having a runny nose allergies can still be affecting the lungs. You may be having slight food allergies that you don't know about that could be exacerbating the symptoms so I check into food allergies. (You can develop any allergy at any stage of life) But up until then you can do that I would say try a daily antihistamine one that doesn't make you drowsy either Zyrtec or Claritin should be fine. Take it for 2 to 6 weeks and see if your symptoms improve. If they do you know it's allergy related. As far as the exercise issue- use your albuterol about 20 minutes beforehand as a preventative then see how you do with your breathing during exercise. Use it one more time if you absolutely have to but if that doesn't do anything might want to stop and go to the ER if you think you need to. It also wouldn't hurt to grab a pulse oximeter off of Amazon they're pretty accurate and they can also tell you your spo2 which is your oxygen saturation. If it dips into the 80s (someone correct me if I'm wrong here) you should probably go to the ER unless it recovers immediately. There's a reason why the allergy and asthma association of America are like put together. Allergies and asthma tend to go hand in hand and you kind of just have to have control of both of them. \n\nDefinitely keep searching for another answer if you think everyone else is wrong because I support everyone advocating for their health. Also I will say this regular doctors are kind of dumb whenever it comes to asthma I suggest you find an actual allergist to help you on your journey. If nothing I said above helps you, maybe investigate your environment- say for instance did you move homes or did your home develop mold - like there might be a plumbing issue and it's growing mold somewheres? Just some ideas.\n\nOtherwise I hate to say it but welcome to the asthma club. \n\nAnd I just had one more thought, you said your throat is constantly sore- that makes me believe it's also allergy related you probably have post nasal drip. You also may be sleeping with your mouth open. And you also did mention heartburn- there's some sort of like gastric asthma link as well so I would suggest trying to sleep on a slight incline. Maybe try sleeping in the chair for a bit and see if symptoms improve or you can go on Amazon and grab one of those big wedge pillows and see if it improves your sleep and heartburn/throat issues.

i4fbf6h,u1ib8x,"Well, when I went to the ENT first that‚Äôs what we treated and it did nothing. I quit coffee, alcohol, no spicy food, did not eat 3 hours before sleep, and slept with my head raised while on PPI for one month. It did nothing at all. The ENT said I even still had an irritated voice box despite that treatment. Said I need a gastro or pulmonologist because my throat nor breathing responded to the treatment. \n\nThe pulmonologist put me on PPI plus montelukast and advair, which idk if u know, but montelukast is a leukotriene inhibitor which decreases inflammation in the airways and this combination made me feel amazing. My breathing was still not 100% but I honestly could barely notice anything was wrong. So he took me off the PPI since the PPI itself wasn‚Äôt helping from before, and left me on montelukast and advair if I‚Äôm having difficulties. He seems to believe the breathing difficulties are more allergy related. I didn‚Äôt notice the advair doing much help though. But he also doesn‚Äôt want me on PPI for long since #1 they‚Äôre kinda bad for you long term and #2 by itself it wasn‚Äôt helping my breathing at all. \n\nSo my breathing right now on montelukast is like at 75% whereas on PPI it was still at 50% and on both medicines it was like at 90%\n\nI think I might need to visit a gastro but still, my LPR treatment didn‚Äôt even do anything at all to my symptoms but the doctors are sure it‚Äôs contributing to my asthma\n\nI also have none of those symptoms you mentioned aside from burping. I also have very inflamed nasal passages which sometimes bleed. They described it as rhinitis either allergy or reflux induced. ENT said after the LPR treatment my rhinitis plus throat irritation remained.

Those could give you a better indicator which is the culprit. Endoscopy could help you determine the condition of your GI tract. I think the fact your throat is irritated despite taking the medication is an indicator that you didn't respond to the LPR medication despite having the condition.

Once it's determined that your airways have inflammation it's key to find a cause. If it's not the allergens then surely it can be the stomach acid. \n\nLPR can cause breathing issues even without having the stomach acid entering airways though.

i4v0fgu,u170cl,"I'm sorry to hear that, I know that must be a difficult situation. Having a nebulizer may be able to help you function during the day, combined with steroids daily during an episode. The key is to do consistent treatments, two twenty minute treatments (will equal two vials of albuterol liquid solution) every four hours. Stay on top of it, set alarms and reminders. This will help keep your asthma from flaring if you are really struggling, although you will feel a little jittery from the albuterol. One treatment is not enough. \n\nI agree with other commenters who speculate that something in your home is triggering your asthma, and it is uncontrolled. I recommend dusting throughout the house as often as you can, as well as vacuuming and keeping air vents/filters clean (and make sure you have a mask on while you do this to protect your lungs- in fact I recommend wearing a mask while doing any cleaning at all, especially with chemicals). I highly recommend air filtration systems throughout the house, although this may not be financially feasible for you at this time. \n\nWishing the best for you and your family OP <3",1650046468,t1_i4s4z5k,/r/Asthma/comments/u170cl/my_inhaler_has_failed_twice_and_im_scared/i4v0fgu/

A primatene inhaler has the exact same ingredients they would shoot into your veins in the ER.  The inhaler if abused can cause a stroke but you would have to overuse it a lot.  The same thing can happen from the shot in the hospital or from Adrenaline in your body if your overly excited.  The plan with all speed based asthma medications are to get your heart pumping so the liquids drain off and smoothing of the bronchial airways are achieved.  My actual heart rate has been higher from sitting in an uncomfortable chair than from either form of Primatene.  In fact 2 doctors wanted me to go to the hospital.  I said sorry, I am just in pain.  Someone asked what could be done in the meantime before they could afford to go to the doctor.  I do not play around.

Your body produces adrenaline and if you have ever had a shot of epinephrine which I recommended NOT using unless your having a big asthma attack.  I used to.cough for hours at 5 years old until I would puke from all the nasty stuff then my body would stop the attack and my sadistic parents would smoke 3 packs a day, keep me on the porch in the heat and humidity and with no screen and plenty of bugs and pollen in Florida while they were in AC.  I would turn blue and have the same issue as you lots of mucus.  There were no inhalers in 1972 that I had access to, I would have to go to the hospital and get an epinephrine and/or a Susphirine shot. My step mother slapped me for faking once because she had the air conditioning on me the entire way to the hospital I felt better when I got there.  AC pulls the Humidity out of the air and negates a lot of pollen. That C word of a woman abused me every day from 5 to 13.  Tell your Dad I said he can fight with me, it‚Äôs not your fault \n\nAlso you can try this.  I want you to tell me if your voice cracks after singing a couple of wailing songs.  If the answer is yes (don‚Äôt do the others) I want you to buy 3 things, the salt packets are included in this, buy more salt packets when you run out.  That was 2 of the items.  The third is a gallon of distilled water, never use any but distilled for this Neti Pot.  Follow directions (when you feel better stop using it wait for next attack)Go online and watch a you tube video on how to use a Neti pot.  Water goes in one nostril with the spout while tilting your head sideways goes out the other while cleaning your sinuses.  Never swallow the saline and snot, spit it out and start again do NOT let anyone watch you using it.  Say your sensitive and it‚Äôs disgusting.  My doctor said that my voice cracks because of post nasal drip, the saline will act to shrink swelling and will kill off any infection.  Use it for a month max.\n\nAlways stir the salt until it dissolves in the water before using.  This is the cheapest of anything you can do.

I knew something was wrong when I was 8.  But it really started affecting me in my Sophomore year of High School, I could no longer remember large lists of things.  If I was tired and stressed I could look at an algebra problem for HOURS, sleep look again 10 seconds later I was done.  I had a 149 IQ at 9 and I was really bored the last half hour of that 2 hour test.  Then Parkinson‚Äôs hit, I also had to work because I was abandoned at 14.  I also could sing In 4 octaves but my generous with my time parents would never support me.  All for them, none for me.

And not like the other rabbit holes of anxiety attacks. More like faked images and scenes from my brain. Coming out confused on who what where. Foods and liquids could trip it to where I would lose weeks. I became nasty, mean, just not the person I was for 27 years. Incorrect fight or flight responses to where I would wake up to where I can only explain my old brain was in overdrive. It might be useful to humans 10,000 years ago but not now. I would feel like a gazelle being stalked. I would cry and hide under my desk at work. I would look out and see my body being ripped to shreds. Open doors to cars and see my dead self. \n\nSevere migraines, headaches and rapid weight loss (70 pounds lost) with an inability to eat besides apples. \n\nIt‚Äôs more easily compared to a TBI (traumatic brain injury) \n\nThe worst part is it was some way addictive the meds. I would become irate over slightest changes In schedules. Sending me in mental rollercoaster. \n\nThe thing is on this med how the studies were done by Merck in the 90‚Äôs would not fly today. On their testing they were not looking for all of this on an allergy/asthma med. \n\nA leukotriene inhibitor is merely a sick trick.

This is cause I know what it's like to not sleep cause I can't breathe right. Last time I had the flu it was also terrible so I expected covid would exacerbate asthma similarly. But all the evidence points to asthma not being worsened by covid so I felt like that was a big win.\n\nAfter getting vaccinated I flipped the switch and stopped worrying about covid. I started going back to the gym and working on my physical health again (which I had severely neglected and I was about 30 pounds overweight by the end of 2020 despite have been in the strongest shape of my life pre-covid). So post-vaccination I've gotten back to normal and I'm exercising frequently, going to the gym without masks (once mask rules were relaxed again), playing basketball inside without masks, and doing anything else I'd like. It's has such a massively positive impact on my life and health to be able to live in this way again. I'm so much happier when I'm going to the gym and playing sports regularly.\n\nI believe I had omciron after christnas when it was extremely wide spread, but it was just a tiny tiny cold that wouldn't have registered to me except for the fact that seemingly everyone had omicron back then. I couldn't get tested so I can't say for sure, but I think it was omicron after a Christmas gathering.\n\nBefore vaccines I looked at upcoming vaccination as being something that would cut my risk of covid by a factor of ~10 or so which justified being more risk averse when a vaccine is around the corner. Now, I don't see a 10x risk reduction coming in the future. So I'd wonder if you're not comfortable going out now, when would you be comfortable going out? At what cost to the rest of your life? I don't think zero covid is likely or possible, so I treat it like any other health threat. I'm not going to seek it out, and I'll be willing to dial back my activities during spikes, but outside of that I strongly prefer to just live my life.\n\nI'm also in my early 30's and all the evidence shows just how bad this is for older folks, so if you're in your 30s I really think it's a tiny tiny risk.

The minute I switched from annoying dry cough to a tiny bit productive, I called my doctor and got a qvar steroid inhaler.

i3wp76k,tyq6n1,"Infections are a major asthma trigger for me. I'm prone to getting bronchitis, and even a normal cold that friends shrug off in a few days will leave me with a lingering cough for a month or two. So it's definitely been hard to explain to generally healthy people that the risk of long-term lung damage is something that has to be very heavily considered, and that something that's mild to them is likely to hit me a lot harder.\n\nAt three years into the pandemic, my current comfort level is based on risk reward calculus and on case counts in my area. There's a balance between physical health and mental health. I do live in a highly vaccinated area, which also influences my calculus. I'll take risks here that I wouldn't take in my low-vaccination rate hometown.\n\nCovid waves follow a predictable pattern where cases build to a peak and then sharply drop. When cases are skyrocketing, I stay in. When there's that dramatic drop and cases are comparatively low, I go out and live life to the fullest.\n\nWhen I do go out, I do my best to mitigate what risks I can. Nothing is completely safe, but there are ways to make activities safer. For example, outdoor dining versus indoors, masking up when going inside a store, running an air purifier when people are visiting, or opening windows.\n\nIn general, I'm not going to go out to a crowded bar, because I don't enjoy that scene enough to justify the risk. Similarly, I wouldn't get enough enjoyment out of a sports game for it to be worth it. I have travelled, which I have always loved and had missed a lot, and it was wonderful. I'll attend a wedding if everyone is vaccinated, and consider it worth the risk to spend time with family and friends. I'm comfortable going to game nights/house parties/barbecues with friends because all of my friends are vaccinated. I'm comfortable with outdoor dining.  And I'll even occasionally dine indoors if cases are low and it's a non-crowded small restaurant, and will try to sit nearest to the door for extra ventilation.\n\nThe thing that's changed the most I think is how I think about planning my social life. In the past, I scheduled things I wanted to do around specific dates. Now it's more like ""I really want to try xyz restaurant that is indoor only, so when cases hit xyz metric let's go.""

Pneumonia was the most obvious complication of COVID but as time goes on its becoming obvious that it effects other parts of the body.

But if I go for a leisurely walk in anything below 32F, the lungs will rebel haha.\n\nTry taking note of those three things when you feel your lungs acting up. Is it hot or cold, is thebair moist or dry, and have you been exerting yourself up until noticing something feels off?
