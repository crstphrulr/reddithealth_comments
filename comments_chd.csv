i5paufu,u8y8br,Hello. I have very good insight. My baby is 2 months (our 3rd child & only chd) and I found out at my 20 week scan about CHD. My baby had open heart surgery within the 2nd week of life. My baby is doing amazing and we‚Äôre in the Midwest but traveled to a larger city. Check with the hospital about a Ronald McDonald type of house (their social workers will contact you anyways with tons of information and resources). My husband took off time from work (vacation/personal/fmla) and we had Grandparents/Aunts step in to help watch our other children (2 & 4). My husband watched/stayed with our kids but came to the hospital for the surgery. It‚Äôs absolutely terrifying but babies are very resilient. We had surgery on 2/22 & we‚Äôre discharged home on 3/07. My baby is just like any other baby by not missing milestones and exclusively breastfeeding. There is hope and good that comes out of this.

The most complex part of her heart was her pulmonary artery, a piece of that was missing so a tube had to be inserted through it. Doctors told me that, Arabellas nature of her heart, formed perfectly for the circumstance of her CHD, as the PA wasn't working so the VSD took the blood out of the heart, then the PDA took blood to the lungs until she gained enough weight. While the CHD is severe, her prematurity and birth size held her back the most if anything. \n\nPoor baby! I'm delighted to hear he's doing so well.

Lots of people on there to talk with... you might even be able to hook up with a family with similar issues and talk directly with them.\n\nAs for my family. my daughter was born with a large VSD and smaller hole. They patched her larger hole at 3 months, the patch ultimately didn't hold up and caused a lot of issues, they didn't see that til she was 5 months old. We were sent to Milwaukee and the surgeon she had the first time patched it again.\n\nSo all-in-all, she had 2 open heart surgeries and lots of complications due to that. She is not your normal VSD kid. She has an on-going arrhythmia issue (on an anti-arrhythmic called flecainide) and was diagnosed at Mayo last January with a double chambered right ventricle.\n\nShe is almost 4 now and does not gain weight well, we watch her eating habits and everything very well and have seen plenty of doctors and dietitians to see what can be done. The biggest positive for us is how active she is, she's an absolute high energy kid, you'd never know she was a heart kid. \n\nAnyway, my point to all this is, keep going. If you are in an area with a lot of clinics/hospticals... get another perspective. See another cardiologist, or 3.\n\nDoes your baby get blue in the lips? Idk if they make a pulse oximeter that you can buy for such a small baby, but maybe a thumb one would get a reading on the baby's toe. That will help know if they are getting enough oxygen, which is a big thing with VSDs.\n\nGood luck!",1647361204,t3_terozn,/r/chd/comments/terozn/9_week_old_son_with_7_mm_vsd/i0rkt2i/

With some of these defects these weird instances are par for the course to an extent.

So they won‚Äôt have to open you up. They will sedate you, maybe not even deep sedation, and do the procedure through the arteries in your neck, arms, and legs.  They‚Äôll patch your hole or (this is not the technical term) unstick your valve  and that‚Äôs that. It‚Äôs scary, absolutely. But if you‚Äôre gonna have a defect these are some of the best to have.

hznscja,t8cq6x,"My baby is a PA-IVS. She didn't have the growth restriction,  but due to a placenta issue she stopped growing around 34 or so weeks. Induced at 38.5 and she was 5 pounds 12 oz. She is frequently referred to as a preemie, but she wasn't. We had all the fun bi-weekly visits too. \n\n The biggest challenge was the  size of her veins. It took a full 24 hours to place her PICC line because they couldn't get it done. She was also on a blood thinner that needed frequent testing, and it was frustrating because the blood drawers could never get it done--they would need to call a NICU nurse. She's 2 and now at 35th, and it still takes them 3 tries to draw blood. I think it's just one of those things. \n\nThe first week was tough because the prostaglandin wasn't really working. Nothing to do with size. I don't think her size affected anything with the caths. We had a BTT Shunt at about 7 days. The small vein thing was a pain, but nothing serious. \n\nFor growth, they only cared that she gained on her curve--the 5th percentile.

hzqeiao,t8cq6x,"My son was born with pulmonary atresia with a small right ventricle which is a similar right sided heart defect to your child‚Äôs. He was also born small for gestational age. Both of these things went undiagnosed during the anatomy scan, so we did not know he was small until he was born and shortly after found out about his CHD. \nAs a poster before me said, his small size made it difficult for them to find veins for PICC lines and such, but the children‚Äôs hospital we were at had a great cardiac center and the nurses were all used to dealing with that. His small size kept them from performing surgery right away on his pulmonary valve, which would have possibly kept him from being single ventricle which was unfortunate.\nThey stented his PDA via cath procedure until he got his Glenn at 5 months. He struggled with gaining weight and remained in the <1% for weight up until his Glenn surgery. \nAfter his Glenn surgery, there was a huge difference in his weight gain and within a few months he was in the 50th percentile for weight and height. It was quite amazing a difference it made.\nBefore his Glenn surgery, they will probably have to fortify your breast milk/formula with xtra formula for higher calories to help with growth. \n\nOur son is about 9 months out from his Glenn surgery and to be honest, other than his scar and his slight color changes when he is cold, you can‚Äôt tell he has a heart condition. The time before his Glenn was pretty rough and stressful, and he wasn‚Äôt a very happy baby but now he plays and does everything a kid his age is suppose to do and is the happiest kid I know.

Thank you so much for commenting and for the encouragement about tiny babies and the skill of the surgeons, that is really a good point. We have a consult with our heart surgeon this week, so I think that may set my mind at ease, too.\n\nI am definitely trying to brace myself for a long NICU stay. I've heard a lot of very different estimates from different doctors about how long they think our baby's initial hospital stay could be, so I'm sure it's just going to depend on how early, how small, how well he responds to feeding, etc. \n\nI hope you don't mind but I peeked at your post history and saw that your baby has a chromosomal disorder. We are potentially facing that as well. The MFM also discovered a kidney anomaly (pelvic right kidney) in our baby. They don't expect it will negatively affect his kidney function or have any real medical implications, but the combination of IUGR and two different anatomic anomalies make the docs a bit suspicious that there is more going on - although they don't really have anything specific in mind.

The period around getting our initial diagnosis was the lowest and hardest time of my life so far, tbh, but I feel so much more acceptance and hope now 10-12 weeks later. Hopefully you can avoid dealing with any growth issues. Like you said, it is interesting how CHDs seem to be related to growth issues and I've tried to read up on it in the medical journals. Our MFM has said sometimes there is genetic issue that causes both the CHD(s) and the restricted growth potential, or sometimes it's a placental issue that might have began at the same time as the CHD in the early embryonic stages.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, have your docs suggested you get an amnio? I was initially told it wasn't really worth it because the heart defect we're dealing with isn't strongly connected to any genetic syndromes. More recently, the MFM has pushed for an amnio because of the growth issues and because they discovered a second (likely benign) anatomical difference. But they also told me the chances of an amnio causing preterm labor are higher now that I'm farther along. I kind of wish I had just done it earlier, but I just don't want any more stress at this point, so I'm planning to have them do genetic testing on baby once he's born.",1646678315,t1_hzpzfa0,/r/chd/comments/t8cq6x/baby_with_critical_chd_and_intrauterine_growth/hzqh1cc/

They prepared us for the possibility of a feeding tube and sounds like it's very likely will have to add extra calories if we use pumped breast milk for tube feeds. I'm sorry to hear that your son's small size prevented early surgery on his pulmonary valve and that it might have saved a ventricle otherwise. I'm sure it's hard not to get caught up in ""what ifs"" even though he's doing great now.\n\n I am so, so glad to hear about how well your son is doing after his Glenn!

hzrcvyb,t8cq6x,"Don‚Äôt feel bad for looking at public information. Yeah, I had an amnio after my anatomy scan because we wanted to know what to look out for, plus her heart presentation while not super deadly in the end was a very rare one. It made a huge change in her prenatal care plan. Speaking of which, one thing that I figure is worth bringing up though is that my daughter only had her main condition show up on the amnio. Blood testing after birth couldn‚Äôt pick it up. Her main condition is called mosaic trisomy 16. So her extra chromosome isn‚Äôt present in all of her body. So you don‚Äôt have to go with the amnio, but if the testing after birth is inconclusive it could be a mosaic disorder or something. I was pretty surprised myself.

hzqixzd,t8cq6x,"Yes - that's what I've been seeing too! I haven't had a good discussion with MFM myself though about the relation of weight/genetic/CHD though, mainly just all self read. Unfortunately, the MFM I really like went out on maternity leave just as we received our real CHD diagnosis (well our first one - ended up finding 3 more defects with Cardiology). \n\nI did get an amnio! I had an abnormal NT scan at 12+6... which led me to taking NIPT test (I hadn't originally because we didnt with our first and felt low risk). That came back low risk but after speaking with MFM, I knew I just wouldn't have any chill so at 16+6, I had an early anatomy scan + the amnio. At that anatomy with MFM, we found out we had the AVSD. The MFM was awful and just said it so nonchalantly and said she'd be fine with surgery (I was na√Øve to think that would be the extent of baby girl's issues!).\n\nOur amnio took a full 4 weeks to come back fully - but we've been told all genetic tests look okay! And we even did the microarray. Not sure if that provides any comfort. \n\nAt 23+6 was when we had our first fetal echo with cardiology and thats when they broke the news of DORV,TGA and pulmonary stenosis.. so I've had 3? weeks to digest the news.. we go for another echo with cardiology next week. It's just so much to take in. I'm supposed to have a growth scan next week but they didn't book me appropriately and are backed up.. ugh.\n\nGenetic testing once he's born is probably the route I'd go if I were in your shoes at this point. My experience with the amnio wasn't that fun - I had read most people say it was painless, but I did not experience that and they jabbed me twice lol. GAH! I cringe.

Depending on your daughter's diagnosis and then her actually physiology at birth will determine what/when she may need surgery.  Luckily with babies, they will heal really well scar wise.  You'll notice them there as thin light lines mostly.  Generally the older the child, or the more surgeries on the same site, the thicker the scars will be.  Check out Mended Little Heart's [Rock your Scar contest](https://mendedhearts.org/connect/get-involved/rock-your-scar/) to get an idea.\n\n\nFor our HRHS type defects, we had a thoracotomy surgery at birth, the Glenn procedure around 6 months, and a Fontan at 2.5.  For the Fontan, we were one of the unlucky families where our child did suffer from lymphatic system damage.  Specifically in our case,  Chylothorax, or a continuous build up of fluid in the chest cavity.  This required us to have an extended hospital stay until the drainage stopped.  From our heart surgeons experience, with the approximately 1000 surgeries they do a year, they will have maybe 2 that result in longer complications like ours.\n\nWith the lymphatic system, since it is basically all over, open heart surgery is likely to cause some issues.  We ended up needing a Fontan revision, but the surgeon didn't actually want revise anything once he reopened our child. However, just 4 weeks after the surgery, all drainage stopped!

hwplli9,sqkld7,"Hey there, Concerned Mama.I don't have kiddos with CHD's. I was the kid with the CHD. I had the exact issue your son does.I was born in the late 90's with a severe case of pulmonary stenosis. Two of the leaves on my valve had grown together and the valve pathway was heavily restricted. I was born absolutely silent. I was the worst case the hospital had ever seen. My surgeons operated the day I was born due to constricted blood flow to my lungs, and I was given optimistic 50/50 chances for survival post-procedure.Medicine has come so, SO far since then. They do these procedures all the time now! Mine was archaic in comparison. To my knowledge, It was a pretty new proceedure when I had it done. They didn't even have kid-sized balloons. They used an adult sized balloon and just tried not to blow it up all the way.The end result of my procedure was a pulmonary valve that was torn open too far. It leaked. Due to the way it is positioned in the heart blood sits on top of the valve in its closed position. I had a constant trickle of blood back down into the ventricle. This left my heart working at about half capacity (doing about two pumps to handle the volume it should've been able to do in one) but was a condition I could live with, whereas pulmonary stenosis to the severity with which I had it was one I could not.\n\nIn my case, the pulmonary valve and my heart murmur continued to worsen. I had Open Heart Surgery and a replacement valve installed 13 years after my first surgery. That valve was rejected by my body and calcified, so I had it replaced again two years later in the cath lab with a Melody valve.In my case we knew we were going to have to do open heart in my future, but we were aiming to put it off until I could accept an adult sized valve, rather than having to do multiple operations to replace it as I grew. When they went in for my open heart surgery, they also ended up patching a hole in my heart they never knew was there.Now, they can do some crazy stuff in the cath lab, including total valve replacements! Your little one may end up needing another surgery, like I did, but with how far these procedures have come they may be able to correct his issue entirely on wednesday, or at least to the point where he can have an excellent quality of life, without ever having to do open heart. To quote my surgeon""Your heart will never be normal, but we want you to feel good and be able to do what you want to do in life.""If he does need a procedure down the line, medicine continues to advance, and he may be able to have a super simple cath lab procedure like my third surgery. I was in the hospital for all of three days for that one. It was crazy.Let me tell you something else. It has absolutely been a lifelong battle. From day one it was a battle. I picked up two endocrine disorders around age 12 and pediatric scoliosis around age 10... I could never get into athletics because my heart couldn't keep up. I was always the 'runt' of the group, both among my peers and my siblings.Just because it may be a battle for the long haul does not mean it is unwinnable. I was medically cleared to do whatever I wanted athletically in 2014 after surgery #3.Today I am healthy, happy, and athletic. I completed a three mile run Friday night and I have another planned for tomorrow.If I can help answer questions or if you just need someone to talk to, please feel free to reach out. My family and I have 'been there done that' so to speak, and I sympathize.

He's doing absolutely fantastic. \n\nI'm not sure where you are in the world, but in the US you'll hear a lot about Boston children's and Cincinnati Children's being the places to go for this defect, but the important thing is if your medical team has experience with this defect. It is one of the more rare heart defects out there. The repair itself hasn't changed much over the years. The after care has significantly improved though and has improved the overall survival rate to around 90%. We had our sons repairs done at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. \n\nIt's scary to hear your child has a heart issue. Take it day by day and keep a notebook of questions and answers to those questions. You'll have tons of doctors appointments and they tend to blend together. I kept a notebook of appointment summaries to help keep everything straight.\n\nYou also need to be sure you're taking care of yourself. Truncus isn't a problem while your child is inside of you. Truncus becomes a problem after she is born. Nothing you do can make the defect better or worse so don't get caught up in being extra worried about possibly making things worse. Just do your normal pregnancy stuff and try to keep your head held high because your daughter is going to be part of a very special group of people. \n\nIf your in Facebook, there is a very good group you should join called  Truncus Arteriosus Kids and Adults.

That being said, he was mostly himself after a week or two at home. \n\nThe other thing that was surprising was how much he wasn't himself at the hospital. He wouldn't talk to any of the doctors or nurses and didn't want to play with toys. It was due to an electrolyte imbalance, which can cause all kinds of issues. In fact, when people seek help for psychotic episodes the first thing they do is check electrolytes, as that is often the cause. It can really mess with your mental state. \n\nAfter coming home we did a lot of baking, watching TV, reading.

So make sure you have a way to get food and drinks for yourself and bring plenty to do.\n\nFor my son, I brought some of the stuffed animals he kept on his bed at home and his own comforter to make things more comfy. I also had a bag of little inexpensive wrapped surprises (like matchbox cars, little toys) to unwrap when he needed an incentive to cooperate or as a reward. \nOther than that, anything that they like to do or watch at home will be helpful to pass the time.\nKids don‚Äôt know surgery is a big deal, so they heal faster than adults. And the doctors usually want them up and walking as soon as possible.

I'm sure your baby is in good hands and will flourish!!!\n\nI think it's better - if they need a surgery - to have them go through it as babies, when they won't remember, won't be scared the same way they would be at 2,3,5yrs old etc. It's heart-wrenching for us parents, but I was advised that CoA surgery is one of the least risky of the open-heart surgeries.\n\nThe recovery is where it can vary, I think. It can vary on how fast they come off oxygen, how all their stats are, etc as they are weaned off of help and monitors. Some take longer than others. It's tough to watch the procedures needed as they progress, like replacing feeding tubes and pulling out the drain tubes. The hospital will show you pictures of what he'll look like with 100 wires and tubes, and brief you on the steps. It helps to mentally prepare yourself. The wound care can be a saga, too. His got infected, and opened up again, and it was an issue for a week or so, but the antibiotics nowadays are fantastic. He just has a slightly more gnarly scar now. \n\nFor us, the feeding was the big issue. (Lucky, really, in perspective). but what a saga it was. He was too weak to feed enough,  it hurt his wound to be held to feed, but when given painkillers he was too doped up to feed... it went around in circles. He was in the hospital for 6 weeks, and nearly 4 of those were just for feeding recovery.  Now, yours is 5months, so already knows how to feed, so you will probably have a much smoother time at this step.  He might lose weight - mine lost a ton - but once he went on solids he started eating like a sumo wrestler and any weight issue was gone!  \n\nAnother issue afterwards is the slowdown in physical milestones/progress, due to lack of movement for a while.  The main arterial line they put into the neck made my son have to lay with his head to one side for 2 weeks. This was a hard habit to break after, and he had a noticeable head tilt for a few months, we saw a physio, etc, but it all resolved itself. His head got slightly misshapen, too, from pressure on 1 side,  but if that still exists, you can't tell at all, it's so minor. I could tell when he was a bald baby, but never with hair. He was a bit late in some of the next milestones, like tummy time, pushing up, sitting up, etc, but just barely. No lasting issues at all.  \n\nWith the open-heart approach to CoA, they have to disturb a vocal nerve (that curiously loops around the aorta) and can damage it. So when he came out of surgery, he had no voice and cried silently. It slowly came back, though, over a couple of months, and when he turned into a screaming toddler who could talk our ear off for hours,  I wistfully joked about how we were once worried he's never make a sound... \n\nThe main idea in \*my\* experience was that the mom, or the primary hospital-present caregiver, has to be the biggest advocate for the baby. Be on top of what's going on. I found the docs really relied on me. I kept the records of his feeding amounts, too, his weigh-ins, alongside the nurses. I took pics of his wound when they'd replace the bandage, so when the doc came around on rounds, I could show him what it looked like underneath.  It sounds llke I had it together - but I didn't.  Different nurses, and different docs, will have different opinions, and we bounced around like pong between them. I deferred totally to them, which was mostly the correct thing to do, but not 100%. Feeding schedules, plans, etc. I would say ""oh, but the last nurse said x so we're doing that feeding plan"" and the next shift nurse would want to change it... in retrospect, a baby-led recovery is best. My son needed to feed tiny bits on demand, instead of the military-like hospital 4hr feed schedule, and we finally realized this,  and he made it home without a feeding tube. \n\nThe other main idea in \*my\* experience was the slap-in-the-face reality that once becoming a mother, you are no longer a full person but exist to take care of the baby. This was cast so clearly in the harsh fluorescent lights of the hospital. I had a lot of birth injuries and noone cared one iota. But, you have already been introduced to this phenomenon and hopefully have recovered well from birth. So you won't be going through them concurrently, which is good.  There's a lot of lip service given to ""take care of yourself"" but there was some weird social pressure between the nicu moms of who martyred themselves more for their sick baby.  Watch out for that. You will find this out in the world, too. I actually went  to see a therapist for a while, years later, to kind of debrief about the journey it had been for me,  and within minutes she's telling me of her son's surgery, of which was of course worse, harder, longer, she struggled more, etc, and made me feel like my struggle was nothing.  F& her!  So please, even if your baby's surgery goes really smoothly, or not, or has small-ish bumps in the road like mine, it can take however big or small toll on you mentally and physically, and don't let anyone minimize your experience.  \n\nI wish you and your baby all the best  xx",1641507746,t3_rxnkc3,/r/chd/comments/rxnkc3/any_parents_of_coa_babies_willing_to_share_their/hrjxfuu/
hrkpjw3,rxnkc3,"My son was diagnosed in utero, and had his surgery at 1 week old. That first week was also spent waiting and scanning to see how the early heart development went and determine the type of surgery.\n\nWe lucked out and did the thoracotomy (in through the side instead of through the front), which has a slightly shorter recovery time. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital, including the week of just hanging out to see what would happen.\n\nHe also had the partially paralyzed vocal cord, which made feeding a bit complicated for awhile and his voice was tiny and hoarse. Also lost weight, which was the biggest struggle he had the first two months or so. As a rampaging almost 3 year old, I sometimes wish he stayed a little quieter...\n\nOther interesting side effect - since the heart was pumping extra hard against the obstruction for so long, once that was removed he had some temporary pulmonary hypertension. This was treated with sildenafil, aka Viagra (grape flavored, apparently). Pro tip, insurance companies chuck it at old dudes like Skittles, but hate paying for it for babies apparently, so get those approvals rolling early if you need it. My doctors waited too long, which is how I ended up dropping $10k on a credit card at the hospital pharmacy on Friday night Viagra. Yes, it triggered ALL the fraud alerts. Good times.\n\nAnyway, it's a lot to take in now, but it gets better.

hrg0bnu,rx1c4t,"We had a shunt put in in June, and just did a complex bivent repair on 12/17.

If that doesn‚Äôt help, focus on all of the positives that will happen after surgery. We had and NG tube for feeds for 6 months so I can empathize on the feeding frustrations. Most of the time I have felt frustrated it was because deep down I was scared.

hre710s,rwugvw,"My 13-month-old was born with PAIVS, another rare one, though I hadn't heard of what your baby might have. We did not know she had it until she was born. They didn't catch it at our ultrasounds. It was a terrifying time but in retrospect I feel like parents that know before have so much more time to fret about the what ifs! \n\nThe good thing is that all babies are born with something called the PDA, and they can do any number of things to keep that open to allow the heart to pump and work correctly (or at least how it was while they were in utero) while doctors decide how and when to repair. I had no idea of this until my daughter was born and they gave her medication to keep this open while they lifeflighted her to Children's Hospital of Michigan (I gave birth at a small hospital south of Detroit that had absolutely no NICU let alone pediatric cardiology). \n\nI know FB is a dumpsterfire most of the time, but I found a small FB group community of people with my daughter's condition and other parents to other small children with it and it's helped me so much. It's always worth a check. And also, once you are able to go to the specialists and you'll get a team set up for your baby, social workers from the hospital will be in contact with you and they do have support systems and help. You won't be going into this clueless, no matter what. \n\nThe day my daughter was born, the cardiologist gave us the diagnosis with all the worst case scenarios. It was truly shocking but he did give me a piece of advice I held onto until we brought my daughter home (she was in the NICU/CVICU for a month), and that is ""don't google it."" Obviously, I've since googled it but I'm glad I didn't then because I could focus on only my child and not carry the weight of every child who's had her same thing ever.\n\nOne crucial advice I have is that it really might not be that exact one the OB believes it is. Almost all of the other moms I've spoken to, their baby's diagnosis differs somewhat from detection, to ped cardio, to birth even. They really don't know the extent of anything until they're able to go in with a catheter after baby is born. Some worse, some better, it really just depends and no two patients are the same. So just brace yourself for a bumpy ride. \n\nAs for encouragement, it is absolutely valid to be upset and it's going to be a hard road. Take care of yourself. A lot of moms find solace in c-PTSD help because it will be an ongoing trauma that will hit in waves. I'm over a year out and I still have days where i ruminate about the worst, but my daughter is taking her first steps and is absolutely normal in every way. \n\nEnjoy your pregnancy and congratulations on your baby! I know it's easy to say for a stranger on the internet, but your body is keeping that baby safe and sound and growing them well!",1641411095,t3_rwugvw,/r/chd/comments/rwugvw/extremely_rare_chd_cor_triatriatum_sinister/hre710s/
hreggam,rwugvw,"First off, reading your post was like a blast into two years ago for me. Two years ago (almost to the day) I was 29 weeks and found out about my son‚Äôs heart defect (dorv, pulmonary stenosis, and transposition of the great arteries). It‚Äôs much more common than yours but still less common and far more severe than most of the defects that make up the ‚Äú1 in 1000 kids has a cardiac defect‚Äù stat.\n\n\nRight now it feels like you‚Äôre robbed of your happy pregnancy and are in mourning even though your child still has a chance at a happy life thanks to modern medicine. So first off just give yourself the chance to cry and scream in the shower and wipe your calendar of whatever you need to grieve. Only let people into your home who will be helpful and not need you to falsely hold it together. When you‚Äôre ready to talk to people about it, you‚Äôll know. \n\n\nNext when you do get a chance to see the surgeons, I recommend you get a nice notebook and pen & write down your questions and answers as docs respond (or have your partner do it if you are too stressed), and come back to that and Google them later. I frequently was high on emotion and stress while asking them, and found I rarely understood them while there and needed time to look into things myself when calmer. If I hadn‚Äôt taken notes I wouldn‚Äôt have known what to look up. It is also interesting to look back now and see what we thought at the time and how some things were slightly different and some as expected. You can keep the notebook to make short updates as your child‚Äôs life goes forward and for surgeries, vaccines, etc. I still use mine for things like weight checks for weaning off the gtube and even when he gets sick. When I look back on these notes I see how strong he is and how incredible he is. I even put happy stuff like crawling and walking and other firsts. It‚Äôs his special version of a baby book I guess. \n\n\nThere are some YouTube‚Äôs out there that diagram how surgical repairs are done without being gory. I don‚Äôt know if there are any for your child‚Äôs diagnosis but if not perhaps your doctor will have similar materials for you to peruse. I found these to be very helpful in understanding what the plan was for my child. \n\n\nGet yourself familiar with the hospital you‚Äôll be at and get a tour if you can. Find out about covid restrictions. At ours they only allow two caregivers and no one else so if you have other kids like us you‚Äôll need to arrange childcare for the others any time you‚Äôll be at the hospital. If you plan to pump or breastfeed they often have free meals available to you and hospital grade pumps. \n\n\nSince I see you‚Äôre in PA- your hospital social worker will set you up with secondary insurance forms. Do not forget to fill them out asap- this is what keeps your child‚Äôs healthcare free for you. Basically heart kids have a disability and qualify for govt insurance. Even if the hospital bills your for third party stuff or copays: call them and tell them to send it to secondary insurance because you should be charged for nothing but parking and food. \n\n\nWhile you‚Äôre inpatient, don‚Äôt be afraid to lean on your hospital‚Äôs version of Supportive Care. I became good friends with the rep there and still talk to her now. They are there to help you through it, so you can be the best parent to your child. They can get you a lot of things to help the time pass and also just be a friend and shoulder to cry on if you need it. If you don‚Äôt vibe with one don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for someone different. \n\n\nLastly: 1) We live in the best time in all of history to be a heart patient. 2) you‚Äôre already near a stellar hospital. Two great starts to giving your child the best chance he/she can have at a good life.  \n\n\nWelcome to being a heart parent, I wish I never had to welcome anyone here, but know you‚Äôre not alone. It is a rough ride but our kids are fighters and we are their advocates.\n\n\nFeel free to message me any time. I‚Äôm on the other side of the state from you but I‚Äôm happy to be an internet support should you need one.",1641414949,t3_rwugvw,/r/chd/comments/rwugvw/extremely_rare_chd_cor_triatriatum_sinister/hreggam/

hrf6mv3,rwugvw,"Hello and welcome - fellow parent of a CHD kid who was born at CHOP in Philadelphia. It's among the best pediatric heart centers in the country, with a huge patient population - which is great! Outcomes for surgery, should it come to that, are strongly related to the surgeon's experience, so a busy center is a really good thing.\n\nI second the comment that it probably will take some time to know more. We were initially diagnosed with a very rare defect with poor outcomes - interrupted aorta, which typically comes with a whole host of other genetic anomalies. Also maybe HLHS. Trying to squeeze in an amnio and decide if the defect would be survivable, all while trying to beat the viability deadline, was by far the worst part of the process. We were so excited to not have to do IVF this time after struggling with his older sister, but it seems we are destined for complicated pregnancies no matter what...\n\nYou'll certainly learn more at CHOP, but keep in mind that the heart is still developing, so how it looks may continue to change all the way through birth.

hr0n6gb,rupmvv,Oh also (and maybe this isn't relevant) I recently lost way to much weight. I lost 15 pounds which might not be too much for some people but I was already scrawny and now I'm way too light. This happened because I was depressed and not eating. It didn't happen out of nowhere. I have started eating normally again and am starting to lift weights and run. Is it possible that waiting this long to exercise in life can be bad? I'm young but my cardiologist always pressured me to start and he made it seem like it was urgent but maybe that's just me reading into it too much. Could losing weight like that have lasting effects? It was only a bit more than a month. Again I know this might be silly to bring up.

hr1d8i1,rupmvv,"I wouldn't expect losing weight like that is bad long term as long as you're working to gain it back. Losing 15lb over a month or so is definitely way too quick though, which is probably more why your doctor was so concerned. Quick weight loss like that can sometimes signal health problems other than depression. As long as you are able to gain it back easily enough, it's likely not something to worry about. You're not gonna get some sort of long term issue from yoyoing in weight by 15lb once. People usually see health issues from weight loss when it's like, 50lb+.\n\n19 is not too late at all to start exercising regularly. Many people don't start until they are over 40!\n\nAlso, if you don't feel like your doctor explains enough to you (and maybe you don't realize everything you wanted to know until later), maybe try writing down questions you have before your next appointment and making sure you go through them all with them!

hqwy50y,ru1ext," I have ToF. When I was 9 I was told I was big enough that I could have a Pulmonary valve replacement, but they wanted to wait as long as possible to put it in. So I was basically waiting until my symptoms got bad enough to have surgery. I remember discussing what sorts of symptoms I should be aware of, and something like not being able to walk and talk without becoming winded would have been a huge sign that I needed surgery sooner. As it happened, I never developed bad symptoms, and they ended up determining my need for surgery based on an echocardiogram and stress test results instead when I was 14.\n\nWhen is your MRI? When was the last time you had an echocardiogram? Have you reported these symptoms to your Cardiologist?

hps6t5v,rn61ua,"Smoking weed is likely not the best way to reduce your anxiety because of the general bad effects smoking has, especially for someone with a CHD. Anything you inhale that isn't air is technically bad for your lungs, so even weed in vapor form is not ideal. Indulging once in a while, maybe once a month, it's probably fine imo, though it would be hard to find a doctor that recommends that in a state where weed is illegal. If you do smoke weed, I still recommend taking it in a way that doesn't burn your lungs like smoke does, even if it's just cooling it down in a bong with ice. \n\nHave you tried asking your doctor to be treated for anxiety or gone to a therapist or psychiatrist for it? Weed isn't the only way to treat anxiety. There are lots of other methods, therapeutical and pharmaceutical, that you can look into. My sister has anxiety and she has a ton of psychological techniques she uses to help with it, and she's got it pretty well managed now. \n\nYou may also want to confirm with your Cardiologist the relative severity of your condition and risk level of things like caffeine or your ADHD meds. Doctors will always tell you the most conservative course of action, so it can be hard to tease out when something really is quite bad for you or when it's just something you could do in moderation and with regard for how you feel (ie don't push yourself). Like drinking 1 cup of coffee every other day probably is not too much caffeine, but 2 cups every day is too much.",1640328820,t3_rn61ua,/r/chd/comments/rn61ua/asd_cardiophobia_and_weed/hps6t5v/

I officially stopped smoking weed around 15 months ago and on occasion will do a baby amount of some type of edible as I miss the feeling. Everyone is different so not so much advice of moreso hey I‚Äôve dealt with this too, once I quit smoking weed I stopped taking part in the world for around a year, and will say that I stopped consuming caffeine, and any other type of stimulant or drug that increases heart rate. \n\nIt‚Äôs hard to gauge and measure how others react as someone who has what you have or I have can very well never have a problem without throughout their life, you just have to look at it through the lens of just yourself. And if it is that bad. I have extreme social anxiety that weed harmed and helped, weed sent me to the hospital cause I smoked too much, I‚Äôve done other drugs and lived life freely, but it does get to a point where you have to ask yourself if you‚Äôre playing with fire or if your mind is just on fire thinking about it.",1640299826,t3_rn61ua,/r/chd/comments/rn61ua/asd_cardiophobia_and_weed/hpqmpmb/

I recommend finding a supplier that can consistently get you 5mg edibles and doing trial and error until you find the right dosage for you.  I would never take 100mg at a time, I would need inpatient psychiatric care if I did that.  Even 55 mg makes me go stone cold mute for hours.  After a recent knee surgery, I took 2.5mg every day for pain management and went to work with no problems.

If I'm particularly tired and need a boost, I go for tea, which has a lower concentration of caffeine than coffee. I also struggle with anxiety and don't like how I feel when using caffeine, the increased heart rate triggers my anxiety. I do feel that weed helps with anxiety and makes me more comfortable around other people, but you could also look into CBD for anxiety, which can be flower, food, drinks, capsules, just like THC. My anxiety has gotten bad in the last few years, mostly health related, as it's about time for my next valve replacement surgery. Even the increased heart rate from exercise can trigger anxiety for me, but it's important to remember that exercise is the best thing you can do for your heart!  And it can also help reduce anxiety over time.  Also just recognizing when you're feeling anxious and remembering the anxiety is in your head, not your heart.  I've downloaded a CBT app to help myself challenge my anxious thoughts when I have them, and along with that I find journaling to be therapeutic.

hpqz5as,rn61ua,"Having a conversation with your cardiologist is good, I just had a six month appointment today and I‚Äôve had some of my own health grief/anxiety and the way he put it is that, you will always have the chd, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it in the sense that if you have a complication, it‚Äôs okay cuz you can‚Äôt control it. But the way he also put it is that smoking and doing drugs (in my case mostly alcohol due to having a fontan aka liver problems for life) are the things you can choose to do which can negatively affect your life. \n\nBut to answer your question, when I had my omega panic attack. I just quit smoking cold turkey cause I‚Äôve never felt like that in my life since that day, just very powerless and felt like death was going to take me. When I used to smoke and have some panicky/fidgety feelings I would just end up pacing and doing some less bad habits to qualm the feeling and unfortunately I‚Äôve just come to realize that with my mental state as well as place that I‚Äôm in of my life, I just can‚Äôt smoke/do any type of mind altering substances which sucks, but has been the most liberating feeling to me. No longer relying on a drug but besides myself, along with my other mental problems has helped me a lot at tackling life. I was right there with you, constantly checking my pulse, heart rate blood pressure it‚Äôs unhealthy and just hurts more than it helps for that ten minutes of ease. It‚Äôs a psychological experience I realized I was worried about dying cause I have things in my life I haven‚Äôt accomplished so I‚Äôve just slowly and surely become okay with the fact of keeling over and dying if I‚Äôve accomplished what I wanted to. \n\nI apologize as this is mostly rambling but if you can I would give it a break, or just slowly reintegrate it into your system cause I did try to do edibles after my panic attack and doing too much is scary but doing just enough allows you to still feel mentally in control.

After my last surgery when my health worries and anxiety didn't stop, I worked with a therapist who specializes in medical PTSD and chronic health issues. It was incredibly helpful to work through all those runaway thoughts with someone who understood the unique trauma caused by chronic medical issues. \n\nIt won't solve it completely but you can get tools to manage the thoughts, anxiety and stress.

hnwhf32,rc4buo,"Hey thanks! Well the thing about me is that I was born in 84 with TGA and I was never really out of the woods like a lot of people on this sub seem to thankfully be. I was chronically having problems up until I was a late teen when I got a break, but Adult Congenital wasn't a field then. When I started having issues again when I was in my early 20's I was still being seen by my original pediatric cardiologists team and I started displaying weird stomach symptoms. Turns out 2 years later when my hospital (which is in a major California city) got their first adult congenital doctor, that I was in heart failure. It was a major mess up on many levels of doctors and lack of knowledge, but nowadays this is its own field, so the new kids should have a much better time, not even counting the new technology and meds.\n\nSo yes, from my native heart I have and had stomach issues and received kidney damage, but that was from too many years of heart failure. The stomach issues were how my heart failure actually manifested, because of the way TGA affects the main gut and where I happened to store my excess fluid. Oh I also had Hep C from a blood transfusion in 85, but luckily got that taken care of when that new anti-viral pill first hit the market as I could not before with my heart too weak to withstand the old treatment for it.\n\nTransplant is its own beast. At the end of the day you are trading one disease that's just about to kill you, for another that hopefully has just started. The pills are rough and once again because I was so ill I had a long rough road to recovery post transplant than a lot of people, but I was listed late due to the complications of my case and no hospital outside of Stanford wanting to touch me with a 20 foot barge poll.\n\nHeart defects are so wildly different that even the same two diagnosis aren't the same.  My best piece of advice is be a strong advocate for you kid and teach him to be his own as well.

hmla1og,r5544g,"I would also add that once you find the right cardiologist for you, make sure you're getting the proper care and attention to your questions! I also have pulmonary atresia and when my pediatric cardiologist retired, he referred me to a new doctor. I think she was just too overwhelmed with the amount of patients that she had and as a result, I wasn't getting the level of attention/time. I went from one year of having no line of sight to needing my valve replaced to the following year of this is extremely urgent and if you don't have surgery soon you're at severe risk, but I'm going to move your care over to a pediatric congenital cardiologist who's trying to get into adult cardiology..... \n\nAfter so many yellow flags, I switched to a new cardiologist (who's found in the ACHA website others have linked!) and it's been a world of a difference. I am not due for surgery in the next few years, but we continue to do 6 month check ups that typically involve an echocardiogram, EKG and exercise test. Occasionally we will also throw in an x-ray and MRI. Depending on what type of valve you have, you could also ask if you need to see a cardiac surgical consult as well. Probably important to understand your insurance as well, for when you hit your deductible and annual max. I always hit my deductible but that means I'm just never ending paying medical bills (yay America). If you can, don't let the finances convince you to not be treated. I personally would rather get the test done for peace of mind. You can also work with your hospital as well if the costs are too high. \n\n For myself, we're waiting to find that sweet spot of a valve that's leaking too much and needs to be replaced but also not do surgery too soon where years down the road, I need to replace it again. Other things I'd recommend is you know your body the best. If you start noticing that you're feeling more fatigued (going up stairs, doing exercise), getting palpitations, etc. Make note of that so that you can ask your doctor about it. Lastly, I sometimes find myself feeling like Nemo where his dad tells him (you think you can do these things Nemo but you can't!). Life sometimes just isn't the same as people without heart conditions. I personally struggle with the fact that there's a chance I might not naturally be able to have a baby because my heart wouldn't be strong enough to manage it. I also avoid drugs and go light on alcohol. Often people don't understand what those challenges are so I hope you find healthy ways to communicate and manage what you may be going through.

You'll probably need to see an interventional cardiologist (that's the kind that does congenital heart defects/physical defects, not like heart attacks). I would start with getting a primary care physician you like, getting a referral for a cardiologist your insurance will cover. Those two will work together depending on any symptoms you might be experiencing because of your CHD. (Like my kid's regular doctor sees her more frequently and will check her pulse ox and make sure she's hitting milestones, gaining enough weight, etc) I'm not sure the severity of your CHD, but in a lot of cases you can apply for state supplemental insurance that will cover your cardiology visits.

hk8rs0h,qrq0e0,"Of Reddit Friend, thanks for sharing and reaching out. I am so sorry for the stress and fear you may be feeling. My kiddo had open heart surgery in June of 2020. He was diagnosed with aortic stenosis (9/19) and had a cath procedure done in 12/19. Then open heart surgery was the only next option to widen his aortic root. \n\nWe had a wonderful team of doctors and I think that is important. His cardiologist and surgeon were/are wonderful. We are so thankful for his care team. During COVID our hospital would only allow one parent at the bedside at a time. That was really hard for us on top of the other normal hard stuff. \n\nWe found it helpful to prep a hospital bag for the parent staying at the bedside. Think of anything you can have as a comfort from home in the room. We used things like sleep masks, sound machine, ear plugs, comfy clothes, food/snacks, reusable water bottle, pillow, weighted blanket. We were in patient for a few days in PICU and then a few more days on the general peds step down floor. \n\nOur level of service changed drastically from PICU to general peds. It went from a nurse to patient ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 to something like 1:4 or 1:6. We were helped by asking for assistance from an OT to help us navigate how to move him around safely. Things like getting him out of the bed, putting him into a stroller, etc... were helpful. The surgeon basically told us that at 1 he would be our guide. If he did something to hurt himself he would let us know and likewise if we did something he would let us know. Other than that they sent us home allowing him to set the pace. \n\nWe found that talking about our fears and anxieties with others helped it not to control us or overwhelm us. Our family, friend and church helped us in various ways and we are grateful for that. There are a lot of other great online communities for CHD families that you may find helpful. Our hospital has a FB group just for patients families. \n\nWish you well and pray he has a quick recovery.",1636661104,t3_qrq0e0,/r/chd/comments/qrq0e0/advice_for_a_parent_preparing_for_open_heart/hk8rs0h/
hk8pdvd,qrq0e0,"I would anticipate 4-7 days in the hospital after VSD closure and tricuspid repair, assuming your son is otherwise healthy and has good oral feeding skills preoperatively.  Then in the weeks after discharge you will likely have a few follow up appointments, so you may need to take off work for those.  If the stay is longer due to complications, you may want to request an FMLA leave of absence from work.\n\nThe surgeons I have spoken with recommend keeping them out of daycare for at least 2 weeks after surgery, because respiratory illnesses can cause problems in recent postop kiddos.  He also may have some medications that the daycare would need to administer, depending on how long he is there each day.\n\nBest of luck, he‚Äôll do great!",1636660126,t3_qrq0e0,/r/chd/comments/qrq0e0/advice_for_a_parent_preparing_for_open_heart/hk8pdvd/

hk9jlnk,qrq0e0,"Have the doctors said baby will be able to return to daycare before the 6 week recovery is finished? My LO stayed home with me for 6 weeks, as did our oldest (one had surgery at 1yo and the other at 10yo). It will still be flu season in 3-4 months, I believe, and I know our surgeons (in NV and OK) did not want the boys exposed to germs during recovery because of the intricate connection between the heart and lungs. Baby also will not be able to be picked up under the arms, as mentioned in other comments, and baby will not be allowed to lift anything heavy. If baby is 7mo old when the surgery takes place and then goes back to daycare, it‚Äôs possible baby would be handed something to heavy by another child or baby would try to push up on his arms if there is not a caretaker specifically assigned to look after your LO. I‚Äôd talk to the surgical team about this and make sure the person assigned to close the sternum has weighed in as well. The sternum growing back together is the reason for many of these rules.\n\n*edited to add: I know that it can be very scary to experience pre-open-heart anticipation. Surgeons today are excellent and have technology on their side. Don‚Äôt forget to give yourself time to feel everything you need to feel, and don‚Äôt push yourself too hard if you have any sort of fear response. You‚Äôve got this. You‚Äôre a warrior mom.

hk9jqyb,qrq0e0,"Hi! My daughter (4) has Ebstein‚Äôs Anomaly (Tricuspid malformation and displacement). She also had multiple VSDs and a PFO. In her case, her VSDs spontaneously closed around a year old, but she just had her tricuspid valve repaired with the cone procedure at the Mayo Clinic this past May. It was a day I have been dreading since she was diagnosed shortly after she was born. The days leading up to the surgery were very hard, and I was full of anxiety that all peaked on the day of surgery. The first days after surgery were difficult because she was old enough to be a grouch, and of course it‚Äôs hard seeing them all wired up, but as hard as that was, the difference in how she can run and play is incredible. We haven‚Äôt done daycare so I unfortunately don‚Äôt have any advice for you there, but I understand the anxiety you‚Äôre feeling! Feel free to keep in touch - tricuspid valve issues are a rare one, I know!

hkb9134,qrq0e0,"Not the same condition so of course advice will vary, my son had TGA and had a repair at 9 days old. To prepare, I‚Äôd do a tour (or two) to see the facilities and meet some of the nurses. Write down questions and ask when you do tours. There‚Äôs no real way to prepare for the surgery day itself, so we tried to have a ‚Äúbring it on‚Äù attitude: knowing that it was the biggest step to getting us our healthy baby. Aside from physically handing him over and waiting for the surgery to be over (I made myself busy to distract myself), seeing him in the ICU immediately post-op was the hardest, and quite confronting. Again, it was bittersweet; horrible seeing our baby puffy and connected to a million tubes and wires, but knowing it was necessary for him to get better. And of course keeping in mind that he was in exceptional hands. \n\nWe were in hospital for 9 days after the OHS - I think 2 or 3 in the ICU and then 6-7 more on the cardiac ward, though the last 2-3 were just to make sure he was feeding properly as he was still a newborn. This was in a children‚Äôs hospital. As someone else said, there will be ~6 weeks of absolutely no picking them up by their armpits, you basically have to cradle them like a newborn, and I imagine that will be really rough with an older baby.\n\nAfter my son‚Äôs surgery and first round of vaccinations, he was able to be treated as a heart-healthy kid.

hk9uelh,qrq0e0,"With my 1yo, it was more difficult for me than for him. He was really not aware of how serious a medical procedure he‚Äôd endured, and once his energy returned, it was a bit difficult to ensure he didn‚Äôt push his body beyond its limits. That being said, he had a much easier time recovering than my 10yo did because the 10yo was far more cognizant of the pain in his sternum. It seemed ideal for my younger son to go through it at such a young age, despite the challenges that came along with limiting his activities. My younger son also got his appetite back much more quickly, which was a huge benefit in discharging from the hospital. He was so ready to breastfeed and eat by the time they allowed him to that he ate far more than they‚Äôd anticipated. This made it much quicker to go home. \n\nSide note. If medical procedures make you queasy at all, be prepared for the removal of the chest tube and the line they will put in his neck. I forget what the second is called.

hi7oypu,qgnw8a,"Yes!! Mine is not technically asthma but it's called ""relative airway disease."" It was caused by tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve, a rare form of ToF. Basically, I have a hyperinflated lobe in one of my lungs which makes it dead. My lungs were a much bigger risk to my life than my heart for my first few years of life. I was getting pneumonia every few months and was in the hospital more than I was home. It ended up being controlled by a huge cocktail of asthma medications which I finally weaned myself off of in my 20s and now I'm only on them if I'm sick. \n\nI still do get pneumonia - I had it for several months in 2017 and it was awful - but generally my lungs are in the best shape they've ever been in now.

hhpbb0c,qdv5a3,Hey we are similar. I‚Äôm 34F and 3 years ago I was at 36mm for my lower ascending aorta. I have a bicuspid. My BMI is probably at 22 which is within a normal range. Can you call your cardiologist with your concerns? I was recommended to have a graft but possibly not a new valve. What are your symptoms? I have trouble breathing when I‚Äôm walking up stairs. I don‚Äôt know where mine is at now because of the cost of healthcare in the USA,1634959020,t3_qdv5a3,/r/chd/comments/qdv5a3/deleted_by_user/hhpbb0c/
hhr0wdp,qdv5a3,"My story was similar. BAV My aneurysm was a bit bigger (43 and 45mm) on two different scans), but I'm a guy so I think relatively speaking they're around the same. It was also detected at 31. I heard the same thing about surgery being at either 45 or 50mm, but my cardiologist recommended surgery relatively soon. It didn't need to be immediate, but he strongly recommended surgery within a year or so.\n\nWhile waiting for surgery, the only limitation they put on me was no very heavy lifting. The way the doctor described it was that any weightlifting which required me to hold my breath (like how you kind of take a breath and hold it in to brace your torso), but no limitations on any sort of cardio.\n\nIt's interesting that you mentioned the really high heart rate because I had that both at rest and while doing cardio before I was diagnosed. The cardiologist put me on meds to moderate my heart rate and my resting rate came right down from an average of about 100 to about 65 within a couple of days.\n\nI did ultimately have the surgery about 8 months after being diagnosed. One thing I can't stress enough, the surgery isn't *that* bad. If they recommend you should have it, just get it done. I was in the hospital for about 5 days post-surgery, and the pain is surprisingly not too bad - after the first day or two I was actually only on extra-strength Tylenol. I had a bit of an issue about a week after I went home where I had an irregular heartbeat and had to stay in the hospital overnight while they reset it, but that's a common complication of any heart surgery and usually happens to people while they're still in the hospital post-surgery, I was just unlucky that it happened after. You're not supposed to drive for a month or lift anything heavy or drive for two months, but beyond that you'll get back to your usual self pretty quickly.\n\nI was also overweight both when I was diagnosed and when I had the surgery (about 115kg), but eventually dropped 30+ kg doing keto and intermittent fasting and have been pretty locked in at about 85-88kg since I did that. Just a thought, it worked for me, might work for you. I'm also fully back to weightlifting, so once you're far enough post-surgery there really aren't any physical limitations.\n\nLast thing, admittedly I don't know how doctor selection works in Australia, but to the extent you have the ability, don't be shy about looking around to find the right surgeon. This is a pretty routine surgery at this point, but it still has risks, and you definitely want to put yourself in the best hands possible.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any other questions you might have. I remember when I was where you were, I just wanted to read as many stories as I could about people who had been through it.",1635003759,t3_qdv5a3,/r/chd/comments/qdv5a3/deleted_by_user/hhr0wdp/

hhpmpfa,qdv5a3,I get so winded walking up stairs that people ask me if I‚Äôm okay so now I hide it. I was running 2 miles a day when I found out 3 years ago at 7.5-9 MPH on the treadmill and would time myself. I called it my ‚Äústress test‚Äù and was very consistent. I‚Äôm now out of shape and not as fit. I‚Äôm new in working in Cardiology as a CNA (step up job) and I enjoy the patients so much. I feel safe with my hospital health insurance. I am writing a book about the experience and majoring in Biology now at the University. I was a hairstylist before but my heart would just race doing hair for some reason (especially while doing blowouts up to 115-120). My body temp is always hot. I live in high altitude so I almost can‚Äôt breathe up in the mountains. When I lay down at night my heart pounds and I have to focus on breathing. I hope to see a Doctor soon.

It's really hard to compare across countries. For all the jokes about American healthcare, I literally did not pay a single cent out of pocket for the surgery, completely covered by my insurance.\n\nOn your other question about the valve and aneurysm being repaired at the same time, that will totally be up to your cardiologist/surgeon. They can do both at the same time but the BAV doesn't necessarily need to be repaired at all. They said mine was in good shape and might not need it repaired for decades, so no need to do it now.

hef8ozb,pw6qar,"First of all thank you so much for being willing to open up on here about your life. Hearing about adults like you with similar anatomy to my son‚Äôs has been a big part of how we made it through some very tough times in our kid‚Äôs heart journey so far. So thank you so much. \n\nMy son is a single ventricle (DORV+some other stuff) and is currently Glenn circulation, but will have his Fontan in a year or two. Do you know how your early years were in regards to standard childhood diseases and colds? And then through childhood/Now? Did you/ do you need hospitalization or o2 for that kind of thing?\n\nMy son was born just as the pandemic started lockdowns. We stay isolated because we know single ventricle children have died of covid and we are in a situation where it‚Äôs not too difficult to stay isolated too. For now. But when he gets his vaccines & we re enter society, should we just expect to be in and out the hospital a lot to get over the normal kids sicknesses?",1632707506,t3_pw6qar,/r/chd/comments/pw6qar/ama_parents_or_younger_patients_of_fontan/hef8ozb/
heff472,pw6qar,"So, step by step. \n\nColds and childhood diseases were not a part of my life. at least not prominent. Mostly like any other kid. \n\nNo hospitalization or anything, ever. \n\nI do take my daily aspiring. \n\n\#1 tip, keep your child healthy. Daily exercise and diet. fat is the number one enemy trust me. being fit is a life-changer.  I don't how fit you are but is better for the child if the parents adopt their fitness habits. No fried food, and daily exercise, preferably swimming. Like Dory, swimming swiming.  Also Paintball (Speed ball) . No Jiujitsu \n\nMy worst days were when I was not in shape. Yes, even socially, other kids get ""scared"" to play with cardiac childs. If the kid does not look in shape it will be the worst. \n\nI too stayed isolated during the pandemic, just in case. Thanks god I moved in with my girlfriend. \n\nafter my third surgery,(Fontan) I don't recall a single occasion of hospitalization. \n\nOver all the kid can have an optimal lifestyle if he follows this 3 rules.\n\n1. Stay in shape, and eat healthy. You dont need a sixpack, but you should see at least the top two abs (for men) \n2. NO alchocol. Understand that in many cases what kills us is the liver. While drinking he won't feel bad, the hangover would be horrible, and with age it gets way worst. I cup of wine with the girlfrined is fine. But remember, the liver kills many patients. no smoking either\n3. Let the kid find his limits. As a parent you may be scared. and every kid is different, but I won Brazilian Jiujitsu championships, Paintball D5 championships and Taekwondo Championships. Against other healthy men in their prime. So yeah, up till this day my condition has not impaired me in any way. \n\nPlease Follow RULE 1. \n\npro tip. Ask your doctor for the cardiology dietitian. In the Boston Childrens they have a nutricionist specialized in heart patients. \n\nAny other questions feel free to ask. As of now during the pandemic, I gained 60lb I lost my excericse habits.. I have lost back  45 already, so only 15 left. The difference is just incredible. \n\nanother tip for you and the kid, as well, you will need to guide him through life. Read Atomic Habits.

Unlike keeping my child from getting a cold, which I won‚Äôt be able to do when our isolation ends. Haha. I find it encouraging you haven‚Äôt been hospitalized at all.\n\nI am impressed with your sports and wins, especially given your likely lower o2 sats! We live in the US and I‚Äôve heard many heart kids are very into baseball, because it keeps you active but not too much intense cardio.\n\nI‚Äôll look into that book recommendation, thank you! Although my heart baby is only 18-months and still mainly gtube fed‚Ä¶ we are currently trying to wean him off it and get him to eat more orally. But his favorite foods are pretty healthy, things like hummus and black beans. It is a never ending battle with my mother in law, who is desperate to get him off the tube. She said if we let him eat cookies he will eat and we can get rid of it. I told her i am sticking to my guns, cookies are special treats and if he can‚Äôt gain enough on good whole food, I‚Äôd rather he stay on the tube longer. It would be literally my fault if he got addicted to sugar and bad foods at such a young age, and I can‚Äôt have that weight on my chest. I truly believe it could take actual years off his life, and from what you‚Äôre saying it would also inhibit his daily happiness in a major way. Fortunately she only visits every other month due to the pandemic so it‚Äôs not like there are cookies around that much. Even without a heart problem, my own body is much happier when I am eating healthy foods and staying exercised.\n\nIt‚Äôs great to know that swimming is a good cardiology-kid appropriate exercise. I will definitely keep that in mind.  I exercise in the home around the kids and tell them it makes your body feel good. When they get their vaccines, I will rejoin our amazing gym which has great kids programs and swimming classes for all ages.\n\nThe alcohol thing has terrified me since he was born. The US is filled with peer pressure to drink very heavily, especially in high school and college. I feel very protective of his liver but I am not a controlling mom type. I‚Äôd welcome your tips on telling him about the dangers of alcohol while not being annoying, and thus making it an attractive rule to break?

Hopefully some of it is helpful to you... \nThey told me how they'd switch over my blood thinners from warafrin to heparin injections then I'd have the choice of switching back or sticking with heparin. Warafrin had a higher chance of babies brain bleeding. There's also the problem of bleeding during birth because most of us are on blood thinners so you should be extra aware of that. \n\nThey said hospital trips would be almost constant especially near the end and said someone like me may end up spending the last few weeks in the hospital so I suppose at that point, as a pregnant woman, you'd be pretty fed up and feel down (staying in hospital is so lonely). I feel emotional support would be so much appreciated in these circumstances and being patient with questions/worries etc. \n\nThere was also the extra risks, it's pretty scary just thinking about it never mind living it. There's extra chances of baby coming early. I was told they could be up to 28 weeks early and they rarely make it to full term. Also there's the risks of heart conditions being passed down etc. Being educated on the risks is always important because it'll make the parents feel more comfortable and like everything is under control, and you know what to look out for as soon as baby it out (cyanosis, heart murmur etc.)\n\n\nI recently had an ectopic pregnancy that ruptured, after 8 years of using no protection (6 years ttc and 2 years not trying), I had to explain every single detail of my conditions and it gets so exhausting. Its not the same as giving birth but having professionals who knew the risks and how my heart condition worked (even teaching the students) really helped alot.\n\nHope atleast some of this information helps you üòä\nIt's all second-hand information so I apologise it's not my own experience.

The morning of my surgery I also spoke with the anesthiologist. His biggest concerns related to my heart were related to the inversion table they would have me on during the surgery and he asked if I have played any sports / do yoga to gauge if I've inverted myself before. I regularly practice yoga and have never had significant issues with the blood flow while I'm doing poses like downward dog.\n\nBecause I had such large cysts and ovarian torsion, my outpatient surgery turned into inpatient and I stayed overnight in the hospital. Before they can discharge you, they have to make sure you can be up and moving on your own. When I tried going from the bathroom to my bed by myself, I got extremely light headed and the nurse had to catch me. I was really lucky that my cardiologist happened to be the doctor on call and was walking by and saw my name on the door. She called for blood work and an EKG but everything came back fine. My advice would be try to take it easy on yourself as you recover post surgery.

My panic attack was something serious that I myself went through and never experienced. Your situation is of course a serious one that, I, in no way wanted to undermine. It was also why I followed it by saying you should follow back up with your cardiologist and just voice your concerns with what is happening. \n\nI've been in heated arguments with my team of doctors telling me I was wrong about me experiencing a situation after a pacemaker replacement surgery. But I know my body and I know what I was feeling. They eventually turned my pacer down because it was too sensitive for the activities I was doing. \n\nYou know what you're feeling. It's serious and again I apologize if my first post sounded like I was dismissing your complex, incredibly frustrating, and woefully unheard heart complication.

h6s8asa,osx5ff,"I'm actually in a pretty similar situation to you. Rhythm issues aren't uncommon after an open heart surgery valve replacement. I had rhythm issues in my freshman year of college, 4 years after my pulmonary valve replacement. I saw an electrophysiologist who first had me wear a halter monitor for 2 weeks and record my activity so they could see how bad the arrhythmias were and try to correlate them with any specific activities. Then, they did an EP Study, where they stimulated my heart electrically to try to find the source of my arrhythmia. That ended up causing my heart to not beat properly (polymorphic beat pattern). Because this happened they installed an ICD, which monitors my rhythms and can shock me if needed, and also pace me, if needed. Normally though if the EP Study goes well they can find and ablate the source of the arrhythmia, which should put an end to your episodes. \n\nIf your cardiologist isn't even having you wear a Holter monitor, you need to push them to give you one (or get a new Cardiologist if you can). Prior to my ICD placement, I wore a Holter monitor every year to check for changes to my heart rhythm that they couldn't always see on an ekg. That's usually a pretty standard practice.

Second shot, I didn't have any symptoms until about 30 hours into receiving the vaccination. After the 30th hour, I had a weird chilled sensation. I've had the flu before and got chills and all that but these were bone deep chills. It just felt weird. After I put on a sweater and a blanket I was fine except it was 92 degrees Fahrenheit and I was sweating while also being freezing cold. It was just uncomfortable for me.

h4n46lm,oh54lk,"I'll start with the blanket statement that all cases are a bit different and I would be happy to continue a discussion via IM to give you more specific advice and answer more questions.\n\nMy daughter received her first open heart surgery at 4 days and her second at about 5 months of age. The first involved about four weeks of recovery time and some home care (nasal feeding tube, oxygen) until her second surgery at about 5 months. She's waiting for her third, loosely scheduled to occur next summer based on her vitals. I don't know what procedure your kiddo would potentially face (or the other myriad factors involved) so I'll tell you what that second surgery (the Glenn, or Norwood #2) was like for us.\n\nShe was admitted a day or two before for observation. The day of, we met with everyone on her care team including the surgical staff, who gave us an idea of what to expect in terms of duration, communication, and her care immediately post-op. The operation takes between 4-8 hours, and they reached out to tell us when it was done. Met again with the surgeon who told us how it went, and then we waited for the go ahead to see her once she was stabilized in her recovery room. That's basically it for the day of the procedure. Everything else around that - the recovery time, your care plan, day-to-day home life - is incredibly specific to your child and their case.\n\nSome universal advice and YSKs:\n\nFirst, assume none of the people on your care team actually talk to each other. Your kid's primary care provider isn't a cardiologist, the cardiologist isn't a pediatrician, the charge nurse has an entire floor to run, so on and so forth. Be vocal, speak up, seek clarification, don't relent until you understand something especially if it's bugging you or doesn't seem right.\n\nSecond, take care of your mind and body. You're no good to anyone if you haven't slept. It's very hard to eat well at the hospital and after a few days of that you will feel run down and probably grouchy. Take breaks. Make time that's just for you if you can. You do not need to sit in the waiting room at the hospital for the entire 8 hour surgery. You do not need to sleep there every single night of recovery.\n\nLast thing, and probably the hardest for me, is to ask for help. It's better to make a plan than to wait until you're drowning and need a floatie.\n\nHope all this helps.",1625869768,t3_oh54lk,/r/chd/comments/oh54lk/any_advice_and_experiences_from_parents_of/h4n46lm/

h4n6a6q,oh54lk,"Our baby was 10 weeks when he had his tetralogy repair (in March 2020). It was all a bit of a blur honestly, because there was so much going on - we were evicted from our house because the owners wanted to sell and had to pack up and move house, I had to travel interstate with the baby for the pre op appointment, covid was going crazy and state borders were slamming shut, Ronald McDonald house (where we organised to stay) stopped letting guests in because they were worried about people coming and going (thankfully we were the last people to be accepted). We had been isolating for about a month at that point because we were so worried our baby would get covid and die, or that his operation would be pushed back. So most of our experience with his operation is wrapped up in what was going on at the time.\n\nSome of these things are hospital specific, so it‚Äôs good to ask ahead of time. We were very fortunate to go to a hospital with a large paediatric cardiac ward, and the process was very streamlined with lots of information and support. We also had the support of HeartKids (a charity supporting kids and families with heart conditions - see if you can connect up with someone similar in your country if you haven‚Äôt already). \n\nMonday: we needed to have some swabs taken for bacterial colonisation. I think one was MRSA, but there was another one too. I‚Äôm not sure that this is standard practice, so you might not have to do this. \n\nWednesday: drove up to meet with the surgeon and discuss the operation. Our baby had some unique anatomy, so we had a couple of options to discuss with the surgeon. \n\nFriday: pre-op appointment, we were in for the whole morning, from memory he was weighed and measured, had blood tests, an ecg, a chest X-ray and we talked to the anaesthetics team. We also signed up for some clinical trials. We were told to bring snacks, lunch and water. And I just breastfed on demand and he napped a bit when he needed to. My partner and mum came up to join us that evening (once they moved house!) \n\nMonday: operation day. I slept pretty badly, we woke up super early and got ready. He had to be fasted for a few hours pre-op, which I was anxious about but he was completely fine with it. Only one person was allowed to go in. We got their at our allotted time (I think it was 7) and he was weighed and measured again, and they took his heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. We waited around some more and the anaesthetics doctor and nurse came out to have a final chat and take him in at about 8. I was given a pager and a phone number of the paediatric ICU to call for updates. We just tried to distract ourselves all day. Eventually at about 3 or 4 we got the call that they were finishing up and that it went well. About an hour later we were told we could go and see him. We talked with the surgeon about how the operation had gone and she shared lots of technical detail that went over our heads! Then we got to see him. Luckily they made an exception and we were both allowed to go in. I had seen pictures of babies post op, so I knew what to expect, but it was still pretty confronting. He had some post op bleeding issues so there were about 10 people working on him and he had so much medication being pumped in to him. Once that settled down I stayed a little longer and then we went home to sleep. \n\nTuesday: I went in early to make sure I could be there for ward rounds. Ask your ICU when they round, I think it‚Äôs a great chance to see the doctors each day and get updated on progress. Unfortunately when I left for lunch we got a call to say that he had some bleeding around his heart and they wanted to go back in and wash it out. So he went back to surgery. \n\nWednesday: things started really improving, he started waking up and I think he breastfed for the first time (I think? Maybe it was the following day). He got most of his food through an nasogastric tube and I pumped during the day. I stayed there most of the day and went back to sleep because there are no parent beds in the PICU.\n\nThursday-Saturday: he was transferred to the cardiac ward and I stayed with him overnight on a pull out bed. We were working on increasing breast feeds and coming off of his pain meds. The hardest part was juggling taking care of myself and taking care of him. I had to go back to our accomodation to shower and eat once he was asleep and then rush back to feed him. His sleep was terrible and I always hated leaving him. It was also only one parent at a time which was challenging.\n\nSunday: home time! \n\nIt was a wild ride! And things weren‚Äôt straightforward once we got home. He was a stage 10 clinger for months afterwards and his sleep was affected for months too. Happy to answer any questions!

I agree with the other post here about NOT making connections to others currently undergoing this problem or similar‚Ä¶ I tried it and it was extremely bad and draining for me. One thing I did find helpful emotionally was looking up Reddit threads and/or Fb posts of ADULTS with my son‚Äôs diagnosis. Even though there is never a guarantee of anything, I found it one of the more hopeful things I could do for myself, even when some adults with his issues have some ongoing problems, overall even just knowing they were still alive was a positive thing for me in dark times. It may not be good for you, now or at allzzz or it might be helpful at a later time, so put it in your back pocket if it seems promising.\n\nAlso as much as it sucks - if you need rest or time with another child or your spouse- leave the hospital & get it. You will be sad but your baby is in good hands and you can call in any time day or night for updates. Your baby actually needs you to be coherent during the day, and sleeping at the hospital gets old FAST. The nurses on night shift are WORKING, and have lots of things to get done in your room. My baby didn‚Äôt particularly care & slept fine through disruptions but darn if it made things way worse when daylight hit and I had slept very little and now had to comfort a sad healing. The suggestion to take care of yourself so that you can take care of your child is not some sort of self care BS‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absolutely true and absolutely in their best interest.

h4pqipj,oh54lk,"My son had open heart surgery last summer at 12 days old.

I also spent a lot of time looking at the hashtag for my son's heart condition on Instagram so I would be prepared to see him afterwards. Nothing can truly prepare you when it's your child, but it helped me know what to expect. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask any questions you might have, even if you feel silly, and do not be afraid to advocate for your child. After my son's surgery, we noticed that they put the actual sticky part of the bandaid on his newly stitched up wound - taking it off was torture. No one noticed this until a new nurse was teaching us how to change the dressing ourselves and even then, she went to put the bandaid on the same way and I had to stop her and demand they put a bigger bandaid on him. It turned out that someone in the surgical ward had done that to multiple babies and toddlers who were there at the same time as us. The hospital did an investigation, then retrained their staff. Luckily I had been taking pictures of him daily so we could see that this was an issue straight from the OR. \n\nOther than that, my son did really well with his recovery, and only had pain when he had the hiccups.

h51njhp,oh54lk,"Our baby had open heart surgery at 6 days old. There are a lot of babies that need heart surgery or different procedures right after birth. The good news is that there are great doctors highly skilled in this and medical treatment for heart patients has continuously improved throughout the years. The bad news is that it sucks all around. It sucks to see your child go through anything of this caliber.  \n\nMy advice for you is to not do to much research into how heart surgery went for others because every single case is going to be different. Do research about the surgery and the doctors and hospital where you will be staying. Make sure you and the doctor are on the same page.  I kept asking ""how long"" for everything. How long will we be in the hospital, how long will it be before I can return to normal life etc. and every single time we passed what I thought was a reasonable amount of time I was devestated. The nurses and doctors cannot give you a matter of fact timeline in these situations. We were told that the common amount of time in the hospital after recovering from OHS would be about two weeks. We stayed for three months. \n\nMy husband and I tried to get our baby to take a bottle for WEEKS after the OHS because we were determined not to get a G-Tube.

h51zn4d,ogzper,"I appreciate the sentiment, but there are some important differences in our situations. First, managing exposure risk in a town of 2,000 is relatively simple compared to trying to manage it in a city with 2.5 million people. Your town can basically contract trace itself. Second, my daughter is still pre-op and has a different kind of defect, so her cardiologist's advice is specific to her case. It's really difficult to draw parallels between any two cases, even when the diagnosis is nearly identical.\n\nI feel like I need to push back on this assumption (which I have heard a lot this year) that I'm unilaterally shutting down our whole lives. Most people in our community did not want the responsibility of sharing a bubble with us. We can't find a child care provider in our area that works with small enough groups to be safe (again, per the doctor) or any kind of in-home help. After over a year, and after adults got the vaccine, we've managed to find two families whose kids can play with our kids. We're not *totally* alone but it's been a monumental struggle to get any kind of safe community.

My pregnancy so far has been fine, my heart (and baby's heart) are looking great. \n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a huge amount of data and research available about pregnant and childbirth after the arterial switch operation. (I have found a few studies that I'll link under this comment.) But there are plenty of women with our condition who have had successful pregnancies and births. \n\nThe biggest concern according to my midwife, my cardiologist and my obestrician is how my heart will handle going through labour. However, based on my most recent ecgs and echos everything is looking fine.\n\n Often women with a heart condition may elect for a C-section to avoid going through labour. If this is a big worry for you then a scheduled C-section is totally valid and reasonable option. My cardiologist has told me he does not think this is necessary in my case.\n\nBecause of my heart condition my pregnancy is considered ""high-risk"" which does mean I'm getting a bit of extra care and taking extra precautions. (For example I would not recommend a home birth). However there are many things that make a pregnancy ""high-risk"" so don't let this term scare you. \n\n(I feel like I should point out that I live somewhere with free healthcare so all the extra care I'm getting during my pregnancy is free.)\n\nSorry about the long post!

h1d1l9h,nwq1fh,I recommend you see a therapist. They can help you sort through these feelings. It's important not to worry about things outside our control. All it does is cause anxiety and other issues. Also have you spoken to your cardiologist about your concerns? As someone mentioned cardiology is constantly evolving and a number of these conditions we have have almost become common place to a cardiac surgeon. It's important to look at the big picture. I wish you the best.,1623381868,t3_nwq1fh,/r/chd/comments/nwq1fh/i_18m_am_scared_of_my_heart_defect_and_would_love/h1d1l9h/
h1bog38,nwq1fh,"Lots of good advice here already.\n\nMid 30s here, TGA but I had a corrective senning rather than an arterial switch (similar to a mustard). The switch was pretty experimental in my country of birth when I was born, and my parents preferred the survival probabilities of the corrective procedure.\n\nThe reality is, arterial switch TGA patients have far, far better outcomes than essentially any other CHD. There is every probability you will never have an issue with your heart in your life. The important thing is to keep attending your checkups - proactive treatment is KEY with CHDs, we are patients that are in a management form of treatment rather than heavily reactive. It is better to detect issues before they become big issues.\n\nArterial switch patients show very different physiology to mustard and senning patients, that is factual. It is not at all logical to conclude that switchers may top out in their 50s. They do not exhibit any of the issues that contribute to that outlook.\n\nAs for sudden cardiac death - again, highly unlikely. Probably not much more risk than the general population - far lower than mustard and senning.\n\nNevertheless, the fear is real. I think every one of us in this sub has it to some degree and I can say with certainty that I still have that anxiety every now and then. Over time you learn to cope, rationalise, and make do with what you have. It's easier for some than others, and is often not connected to the limitations associated with your condition.\n\nIf I can speak for myself - spending time obsessing in these communities is exceptionally unhelpful. I don't like to do it and I prefer to encourage people to get out into the world, live your life, and what will be will be. You can make some simple, straightforward decisions that will guarantee better outcomes, and they generally boil down to listening to your cardiologist, listening to your body, and doing things that are good for the soul - meditate, eat well, have therapy every now and then to ask the difficult questions in a setting that will help you understand why you're asking them and finally, pursue a life you enjoy. If you can do all that, you'll be just fine.",1623357197,t3_nwq1fh,/r/chd/comments/nwq1fh/i_18m_am_scared_of_my_heart_defect_and_would_love/h1bog38/

Only issue is I can‚Äôt run in a race and get tired before others in a sprint but that‚Äôs about it and has almost no affect on my life.\n\nThe issue with the defect is a non issue because, oversimplified, your tubes are just switched. Operationally it‚Äôs the same and the blood gets where it needs (unless they‚Äôre also going to wrong chambers). The problem is that one tube made to take high pressure while the other is low pressure so over time pumping high pressure blood in a tube made for low pressure can cause wear and thus the need to swap it out sometimes.\n\nNowadays they can do the surgery with a catheter and one night in the hospital. No more need for major open heart surgery.\n\nGo talk with your cardiologist and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for another recommendation from a major hospital known for their pediatric cardiology program.

He‚Äôs a twin and his brother needed to be born at 34 weeks so we delivered early at a top hospital and he was immediately taken by the heart team. On day 3 of life they decided he could wait to have open heart surgery but he needed to have a repair of the aortic arch. It went beautifully! They came home three weeks later. He has an echo every two months right now to monitor everything else. A month ago his echo came back not great so we went back to his team and ultimately they decided he can wait longer before intervention. I guess all of this to say while the journey is still new for me it seems like one that‚Äôs going to be filled with ups and downs and very anxious moments. Outside of that he‚Äôs a beautiful baby and you‚Äôd never know something was wrong.

h0uoflp,nn9ovw,"My son was in the same boat with the assortment of small left side structures + aorta. Hypoplastic arch, coarctation of aorta (originally looked interrupted, so we also got the diGeorge screening), question of HLHS. I think a small septal defect as well that resolved on its own.\n\nCouple of things - this diagnosis is a spectrum, and at 22 weeks structures are small and still have a lot of room to develop. Expect a lot of monitoring, and you'd want to deliver with access to a great pediatric hospital, since this will likely require some sort of surgery shortly after birth.\n\nBarring an emergency, you can expect a bit of a wait after birth. After a baby is born, their heart undergoes some significant reorganization so they can use their lungs. This may allow parts of the heart to fill out a bit as they get used more. In our case, the hypoplastic arch and left side structures were deemed sufficient in size, so we only got a repair for coarctation.\n\nYou're in the thick of the worst part right now - deciding what to do, on a deadline. In our case, with a few more weeks of growth making the left side look better, and an amnio with no conclusive cause for the anomaly, we proceeded.\n\nHis hospital stay was two weeks, with the first week just sitting around waiting for his heart to get itself organized and deciding how much surgery to do. He's now a goofy 2 year old, whose primary health concern is his propensity for flinging himself off of our couch.\n\nThere are no right or wrong answers to this situation. We thought long and hard, weighed the risk to our family, and rolled the dice, but every diagnosis is different. \n\nHappy to answer any questions, chat about Viagra (did you know they make it in grape for babies?), think through what might not be visible yet (bicuspid valves are common with this spectrum, but likely not visible until after birth, and not a huge concern).

gz8j9p5,niyzhe,"Thank you for the info! From what I understand, there are times when the tricuspid valve is essentially normal but not working properly because of right heart dilation from PV leakage. In those cases PVR can provide enough improvement in TR when the heart shrinks down. However you are right, if the tricuspid has morphology issues (e.g. thickened flaps) or more severe leakage then repair is needed. Unfortunately this is the case with me, my cardiologists believe. Of course I really wish I could just do the catheter PVR but I'd probably just be postponing the inevitable.

What you experienced re timeline is exactly what I've been told.

In the shorter term, I'm not as clear, because except when exercising I have basically normal ability to walk, climb stairs, have full days of activity including (not super strenuous) hiking. Can I ask, what were your energy levels like before your PVR?

gzannt6,niyzhe,"My surgeon was Dr. Fuller, she and her whole team were amazing. \n\nIn regards to energy levels, it was really a gradual decline over the past 10 years, with a pronounced acceleration in the last year and a half. I have always tried to be as active as I could, usually walk a few miles everyday, take the stairs over the elevator etc. In the months leading up to the surgery, i was less and less motivated to walk, all my spare time went to taking care of everyday chores, and I was experiencing symptoms of CHF, like not being able to lie flat on the ground. I could still handle a flight of stairs, but several would definitely mean I had to stop to catch my breath.  I felt exhausted all the time, and would even need to nap on my lunch break on bad days. \n\nPost surgery, one of the first ways I realized I was feeling better was I no longer needed to stop on all the inclines on my normal walk to catch my breath. In fact I don‚Äôt need to stop at all, which had always been a part of my walking in the past. I‚Äôm easily able to stay on top of chores and feel like I have so much more free time now, because I‚Äôm not sitting down to rest all the time.  I really feel my commitment to walking helped make my recovery as easy as possible. \n\nI think I understand how you‚Äôre feeling.  If you don‚Äôt have pronounced symptoms, it‚Äôs hard to decide if now is the right time for this huge event. I felt similarly, my previous cardiologists were telling me that the test data said it was time, but my energy and activity levels at the time said something different. I went to Penn for a second opinion and started exploring my options in 2019, but with COVID and a few other circumstances the surgery got pushed back until this year. I‚Äôm really glad I chose to move forward when I did, because it wasn‚Äôt until then that I really started to feel ill.

gywcp1h,nhfrib,"okay - here's my tip: get it done at a tattoo/piercing shop. DO NOT go to the mall/Claire's/etc. to get it done. Those people are not trained and piercing guns do more damage to your lobes than necessary. Piercing shops are way cleaner, plus they'll be able to tell you how to clean them correctly and help you out if you have any issues afterwards as well.  \n\n  \nAlso, if you want to be extra careful, see if your doctor will call in a pre-med for you to take before getting pierced. (usually 2 grams of amoxicillin/penicillin, similar to being pre-medicated for dental work)\n\n  \nI had my ears pierced when I was 11 or so, (after making sure my doctor was okay with it)  and my mom actually took me to a 'real' jewelry store to get it done.

gxwwses,nb033h,"I'm 35, as someone that has had the fontan and a pacemaker since I've been 3. I had a doctor growing up with bad bedside manner as well. He told my mom and myself that I probably wouldn't live past 30. Incredible mind fuck when I was just 8 or 9 years old. That really messed me growing up... I didn't take care of myself as well as I should. In my late teens and early 20s I lived as though I wouldn't make it till 30. Hope you can read between the lines there, I don't really like to talk about the debauchery I ended up immersing myself with. But I survived my 20s and when I was 29 I got a new adult heart doctor. I did a stress test for him and he said I was one of the healthiest severe heart patients he's seen lol. He lifted all the restrictions the previous doctor put on me like lifting weights and pushing myself when I exercise. He talked with me extensively about how I should plan for a future into my 60s and beyond. He also surrounded himself with 6 other doctors that also coordinate with him about my condition and this new doctor and new team have been one of the best things I've ever experienced. I'm optimistic about my future and I feel good. I was incredibly lucky I didn't accidentally kill myself in my early 20s but it is what it is... \n\nIf anyone that's younger has had doctors tell them you won't live past a certain age, just know those doctors are reading off generic statistics that really shouldn't be applied to 21st century medicine. I was lucky but I'm sure there have been people that have been told they won't live to a certain age and then bad stuff happens to them because of the depression, anger, and anxiety it breeds. I hope this gives you hope... speak up to your doctor. Tell him/her that what was said made you anxious or depressed.

Depending on their age and the type of surgery and their body‚Äôs reaction to the surgery, it could be a quick and easy recovery or it is possible there could be something that causes you to stay longer. It is no fun to worry about but it is good to be prepared for the different possibilities. My daughter has had 3 heart surgeries; at 1 month (in for a month after due to wound closure issues), at 9 months (in for about 2-3 weeks after due to fluid build up around the lungs), and then at 5 years old (should have been the easiest surgery but she had air embolism during surgery that caused a stroke so we ended up in the hospital for a few weeks after and then had to transition to a rehab hospital for therapy). Although she still has some strength and OT issues due to the stroke she is happy and healthy now (almost 7). It is also completely fair to expect that it should go smoothly and you could easily be out within a few days after the surgery.

gwhlusd,n1seu4,"Unfortunately I don't have any experience prenatally. We found out our daughter had Shone's Complex (aortic coarctation, hypoplastic mitral and aortic valves) after she was born. It was a complete surprise. Her ultrasounds didn't show any abnormalities.\n\nAbout 12 hours after she was born, they noticed her blood sugars weren't regulating and her body temp kept dropping so they admitted her to the NICU. While there they found an abnormal ECG and forwarded it to UCDavis children's hospital. She was rushed there right away. \n\nAt first they wanted to diagnose her with HLHS and we were all set to do the Norwood procedure at 5 days old. But after a cath lab, they decided that while her left ventricle is on the small side, it isn't hypoplastic. So, instead they fixed her coarctation at 7 days old. She got through the surgery with flying colors and had no problem eating or taking to breast afterwards and she was home one more week after that. \n\nYou should know the eating thing is a big deal and major factor as to when baby gets to come home post surgery (if your baby needs surgery, that is). Sometimes I guess it's an issue and babies need time to relearn how to eat again, but my daughter took right back to it like a champ. \n\nAnyway, she had some scarring issues with the gusset they placed on her aorta, so she had 2 angioplastys about 10 weeks apart until at 6 months we decided to redo the coarc sx. There were more complications that time because of the scar tissue, but she's doing really well now. They were able to determine that her aortic valve is bicuspid and were able to widen it a little more so that we don't have to worry about it so much. \n\nWe're keeping a close eye on her mitral valve now and go in for an echo every 3 months which is a pretty big deal for us because she used to go every week. Her cardiologist says it's not a matter of if it needs to be replaced, but when. The mitral valve, I'm told, is a tricky one to replace, especially in little ones because the replacement valves don't grow with them. So the bigger they are when it's replaced, the better. Fingers crossed she won't need a replacement for a long while, but it's really just a wait and see game. \n\nAll in all, it's scary, especially at first, but when you get your sea legs  you'll get used to the doctor visits, the surgeries, and medications. You'll get to know all your nurses and your little one will have the greatest cheer squad of a medical team. They'll be like a second family. \n\nGood luck to you, my dear. You can get through this. Big internet hugs to you.\n\nEdit: Oh, and the best advice I can give you is to take notes on EVERYTHING. Procedures, staff names, dates, EVERYTHING.

He‚Äôs asked for second options from others, though, and says everything looks good for now, but that they‚Äôre going to keep their eye on it. While that does make me anxious that one day I may need surgery again (I‚Äôm honestly projecting sometime in the next 10 years) I go by my life trying to enjoy it day by day.\n\nYou‚Äôre still young and I don‚Äôt want to invalidate your fears. I would suggest trying to invest in an Apple Watch if possible. They have an app that can take ekg‚Äôs (series 4-6) or if you know someone who has one ask them if you can take one from time to time.

gw8mp77,n070ty,"Hey there! My daughter was born with critical aortic stenosis, which is obviously not exactly the same but she too had a balloon cath done to open up her valves better.\n\nWhen she was born and swept away to the NICU/children‚Äôs hospital we just had to take it one day at a time. Once we were home it for better(though I admit I still miss having the nurses at night to help lol). Her prognosis after the cath went from ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù and kept improving as she grew. She came home and on about 4 different medications and we had to take her to physical therapy and speech therapy multiple times a week(she had been out in a paralytic and intubated due to having a cardiac even during surgery but that‚Äôs another story). She started out seeing her cardiologist every 2months, then every 4, then every 6.  Now he puts her in the ‚Äúmild/moderate‚Äù category and we‚Äôve even had our most recent appointment pushed back twice(due to an influx of critical COVID long haul patients). Her doctor expects to only see her once a year starting next year and as it stands she will not need any other procedures ever.\n\nMy daughter does everything that other children her age do, for now. The only thing they say she won‚Äôt be allowed is contact sports. She runs, she sings, she laughs, she‚Äôs mischievous. You would never even know she had such a rough start to life.\n\nI know that your babe also has pulmonary issues so I can‚Äôt speak for those BUT it will get easier. Especially once you are home and more relaxed. Also, the two subs that helped us the most was this one and r/NICUParents.\n\nMy best advice for now is remember to care for yourselves. Seeing your little nugget in the hospital is incredibly scary, but she is in the best hands possible. I don‚Äôt know what your routine is like at the hospital but if you are staying in her room with her like we were, try to go for walks, get outside, watch movies, *take full advantage of having night nurses so that you can be well rested.* Remember not to joke yourself up in the room with your baby.

gvwbnsi,mylhuu,"I know this will sound antithetical to all of Reddit, but I spent a ton of time praying and asking for prayer from others for wisdom in making this decision.  It seemed like an absolutely impossible task to complete in just a few short days. While I was doing this my boss and owner of the company I work for called me.  He and his wife merely wanted to ask how I was doing, so I told them my predicament and he happened to have a friend who was an ex-VP of Edwards Lifesciences.  My boss got me in contact with his friend, and his friend (one of the nicest guys I‚Äôve ever met) got me in contact with other executives of other medical device companies. \n\nAs I spoke with them, they told me essentially the same things my cardiologist and surgeons were telling me. At my age, and in my situation, mechanical valves were by far the best way to go. I also couldn‚Äôt sleep at night, so I did the best I could to read studies about bio-prosthetic vs mechanical valves (I say the best I could because during my surgery a few days before I had an eye stroke and tiny stroke in my brain so I was having slight difficulty seeing through my left eye).  The more I read, the more I saw that mechanical valves usually resulted in greater life expectancy than bio-prosthetic. I had thought before that having a life where I could do what I wanted, even if shorter, was better.  I then realized that giving myself the best odds of living longer would be better for both my wife and potential future children. \n\nI also knew that each additional open heart carries additional risk and the longer you are on cardiopulmonary bypass, the more risky it is.  I ultimately decided that though mechanical valves weren‚Äôt necessarily what I wanted, they were what I needed, and decided to trust the expertise of the best doctors and surgeons on the planet. \n\nAs I came to this conclusion, the next day I had a nurse (one that I had actually had before), when he came in that morning I heard a ticking. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was coming from him, but as he moved I heard it following him.  So I asked him, and he told me that he actually had a very similar heart defect as me. I spoke with him at length about his mechanical valves and he assured me that they weren‚Äôt as bad as they are made out to be. \n\nThis eased my anxiety and solidified my decision. I was happy to also learn that my wife and parents had each independently came to the same conclusion, but didn‚Äôt want to influence my decision. \n\nBeing on Coumadin is not ideal, but it‚Äôs by no means terrible or completely devastating, in fact it hasn‚Äôt really impacted me at all yet.  I‚Äôve had to give up a few things I enjoy, but every single day I know I made the right decision.  As long as I take my medicine and keep my INR in range I know I don‚Äôt have to worry about my valves deteriorating and the regurgitation affecting me.  I‚Äôll certainly have more surgeries if I live long enough, but the odds of open heart surgery are much much less and after you‚Äôve had three another one isn‚Äôt too appealing.",1619413010,t1_gvw5lbz,/r/chd/comments/mylhuu/31_year_old_congenital_heart_disease_patient_ama/gvwbnsi/

gvxzzm9,mylhuu,"I'm sorry to hear about your worsening aortic stenosis.  Has your doctor mentioned anything about you being a candidate for TAVR, or any other minimally invasive procedure?  \n\nAs to the fear.  When I was a kid I didn't really have fear about the surgeries.  I think as a kid you don't quite understand and so it doesn't really scare you much.  This past year was a different story though.  Being older, having a wife, and generally knowing what's going on and the severity of it is a bit more scary.  For me the past year or so had been a bunch of unknowns.  Without boring you with all the details I'll just say I completely understand losing sleep over it.  I had nightmares off and on over the past year as I would have a series of procedures, knowing that if any of them were unsuccessful I would be having open heart surgery.\n\nFor me the only way I could deal with the fear and uncertainty was to remind myself (or my wife often reminding me) that my doctors are highly skilled, some of the best in the world even, and that their skills and medical technology meant I was in highly capable hands.  Even more  than that though -- I know not everyone will like what I say here, but I would continually pray and trust in the sovereignty of God and the words Jesus spoke to his disciples as recorded in in Matthew 6:27 and Luke 12:25 ""And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?""  It's certainly still very difficult to not be anxious though.  It's a continual battle.\n\nRegarding health insurance, my parents had very good insurance when I was a kid and I think my surgeries, tests and appointments, along with my medication were either completely covered, or largely covered.

After my first open heart surgery I lived just like a normal kid, it's incredible to look back and see how normal I was.  I ran and played soccer, football, basketball, baseball, etc. with all the kids on the playground and never felt limited.  I would hunt and fish, ride dirt bikes, ride bikes, wakeboard, snowboard, pretty much anything I wanted.\n\nI had my second open heart surgery when I was 14 to replace the conduit that was placed when I was 5.  I was outgrowing the old conduit and heading into high school.  I wanted to continue to play club and high school soccer so I decided to get it done the summer between 8th grade and freshman year.

I didn't really have to bring up my heart problem because my entire chest, sides, and back are covered in scars, so anyone who has seen me at the beach, pool, lake, etc. would know.

gw0p5m5,mylhuu,"Yes my heart requires extra pacing. Each pacemaker has lasted 3-5 years from, 1988 to 2020 lol. Some lasted a shorter time span but it was because of either a wire (lead) not responding or my dumbass as a kid hanging from monkey bars and disconnecting leads (happened twice unfortunately) what can I say, I was a rambunctious kid... The newest pacemaker is saying it will last for 7+ years. Normally the same pacemaker implanted in anyone else would last 10-15.\n\nAs for the thorocotomies; Both of my big scars (bigger than the open heart scar) are directly under my left pectoral muscle. They are about 3 inches apart but run parallel with each other. The first one starts right under my left nipple and continues to my back, just before the shoulder. I think both scars are about 6-8 inches long. It's intense but I'm strict about my recovery and bounce back like a month after. The pacemaker replacements are out-patient surgeries.

I was shocked that after I got them the ticking has not bothered me at all.  I'm very thankful for that.  Mechanical valves require you to be on anti-coagulants.  If you don't take anti-coagulants your blood will clot on the valve and could get dislodged and give you a stroke.  Being on anti-coagulants -- as I'm sure you could guess -- makes you much more susceptible to internal, and external bleeding.\n\nI'm pretty much barred from any extreme sport, horseback riding, motorcycle riding, or competitive sport where there is a risk for brain injury, or severe bleeding.

gv467i8,mu75o5,"Hi there! I was born with PA/IVS, 29F. I had surgery right after birth, and open heart surgery at 4 years old and 15 years old. I am very lucky where I do not have to take any blood thinner or medication outside of amoxicillin before my dental cleanings.\n\nFrom a day to day perspective, I wouldn't say having CHD is a significant challenge - I often forget that I have a ""disease"". Reflecting back, the hardest parts were being embarrassed of my surgery scars (handful of kids would make fun of me) and sometimes having my parents keep me from doing things (heavy lifting, shoveling the snow, cutting the lawn) in fear that I'd be hurting my heart. I would recommend as your child grows up, teaching them to be self aware of when they need to take a break or sit out from higher intensity activities. I find that I start getting light headed if I'm going too fast/hard for a long period of time and have to slow down. I played soccer in middle school and ran track & field during high school so sports are possible! Looking forward, my concerns are family planning. The valve I currently have should have already exceeded it's life so I am doing 6 month check ups to evaluate when my next surgery will be. Per my cardiologist, the valve likely has been so successful because I do not smoke, maintain a health weight/exercise and minimally drink. If I am planning on having children in the next 2 years, my current valve will suffice. However, if I'm planning on having kids 3+ years from now, I will need to have surgery first before planning pregnancy. \n\nHopefully that helps!

Instead of drinking, I would have to be injected (as I was told ;-;) my food. I didn‚Äôt have a surgery after birth is because I was basically using my mom to help me breathe inside the womb. So whenever they did checkups I seemed perfectly normal. My doctors did try to ‚Äúpop‚Äù (or unstick them) my valve to make it function again since it was stuck together. \n\nGrowing up, my parents were really protective of me. I was told that I could stop doing physical activities if I wasn‚Äôt feeling ok and to not overdo it. I remember as a younger child, I could run semi fast, but I had lower stamina. I‚Äôm not really a sporty person and probably should have went into sports. I did feel outcasted and alone since, to me as a child, it seemed like everyone/most of the other kids liked running and playing sports.\n\nI‚Äôve only had 3 surgeries in total because I do try to eat healthy and exercise. I‚Äôm not really into drugs or alcohol. My 2nd surgery was when I was around 1 (parents told me) and my 3rd surgery was when I was 12. My doctors plan for me to do my last surgery for my adult/senior replacement when I‚Äôm around 40. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of surgeries, but I do have to take a blood thinner for the rest of my life or when my doctors say no.

Quick backstory, my daughter was born with a very large VSD.  We didn‚Äôt find out about it until she was 4 months old after a hospital visit for a UTI. They did an X-ray and saw her heart was enlarged. Her hole was so big that it didn‚Äôt even have a heart murmer.   They told us she needed to have open heart surgery because the hole was way too big.  She had surgery at 7 months old and she came through out and did not have any complications.  She is 4 now, no delays whatsoever and is the smartest student in her class. She can participate in anything and doesn‚Äôt have any restrictions.

guw5n4r,msxg0u,"Peds Cardiac Surgeon here. \n\nYour surgery is a simple one.  The risk of any significant complication in the US should be less than 1%.  It's very natural to be worried but you should be fine.  This operation should take care of the problem for good and you should live a very normal life from a cardiac standpoint after you recover. \n\nThere is usually nothing special you need to do before surgery unless you are on medication for some reason and in that case, your cardiologist/surgeon should tell you what medicines to stop before surgery.  \n\nComplete recovery usually takes about 6-8 weeks, but you will be up and about day after surgery in most cases.  You'll have some drain tubes that will be removed several days after surgery.  You may or may not have temporary pacing wires that will also be removed at bedside before you go home. \n\nYou should be able to exercise normally and in many cases, patients do feel like their endurance improves after surgery. \n\nThe scar depends on what approach your surgeon is going to take.  Some surgeons do minimally invasive (Smaller incisions) for this kind of case, but most congenital cardiac surgeons will do this operation via a median sternotomy, which is an incision that goes the length of your breast bone (Sternum).  \n\nHope this helps.",1618689454,t3_msxg0u,/r/chd/comments/msxg0u/asdpapvr_surgery/guw5n4r/

guxac7v,msxg0u,"Before surgery, make sure you have some long, in-depth conversations with your cardiologist/surgeon/care team. You'll want to talk directly to the people who will be guiding you through pre-op tests, surgery, and recovery. Ask them questions about the surgery: where/how do they plan to make an incision and repair your heart. Ask about what to expect from recovery: your time in the hospital, recovery timeline, pain management, when you can get back to certain activities.\n\nPersonally, I'm an active adult in her late 20's recovering from open-heart surgery right now. If your surgeon goes that route, just know, it's difficult to mentally prepare yourself for how hard it can be. One of the hardest things to overcome, besides the pain, can be your mental state. Your body has been through a lot and you have to be patient with yourself. I felt terrible those first couple weeks after surgery and there were plenty of days where I couldn't motivate myself to walk down the street and back just to get in some movement. By week 3 I was able to motivate myself, on some days, to do some leg exercises: half lunges, leg lifts, squats, etc. I'm at week 6 now and my sternal restrictions have finally been lifted! I can now drive, lift my arms over my head, lift objects over 10lbs, etc. The relief I feel being able to really move my body again is incredible! It was frustrating going so long without being able to fully use my body, but a low-activity hobby really helped keep me sane.\n\nThat being said, your recovery is not over at 6-8 weeks. There are plenty of small aches and pains that I was surprised to be experiencing at this stage. There is nerve pain that can last up to a year and I've managed to pull a newly mended muscle in my chest by reaching too far forward. While I'm excited to get back to exercising, there are some days where these little pains really wear down my motivation.\n\n**TL;DR** Just know that you may experience some mental barriers and that's totally normal, but don't expect to be able to just dive back into your normal level of activity. It takes some time to really feel like yourself again. And personally, 6 weeks into my own recovery, I'm not there yet.",1618709831,t3_msxg0u,/r/chd/comments/msxg0u/asdpapvr_surgery/guxac7v/
guzda9w,msxg0u,"As someone who has been under knife more times than I can count on my hand I have a few things that I do before surgery that might help you. \n\nYou wanna get to a place mentally that you are at peace with this surgery and are ready for recuperating. I increase my meditation schedule before surgeries. I also like to do breathing exercises to increase oxygenation while I'm waiting to be rolled into the surgery room. But, being mentally prepared has helped my recovery 10 folds. Going into a surgery trusting yourself and trusting you doctors has a profound impact on recovery. \n\nI also up my stretching and yoga routines. These are low impact and doesn't necessarily increase heart rate like running or normal works out would. Depending what your doctors told you about exerting yourself you should still try to do stuff that increases blood flow and oxygenation. \n\nMake sure you voice your concerns. You don't want that in your head going under. Be vocal about where you are emotionally. I know this all sounds hippy dippy but, it's what has worked for me.

gutkmvd,msj6hl,"3 years ago I left work to go to the emergency room because I thought I was having a heart attack. (For context I have a pacemaker to correct an arrhythmia and I've had open heart surgery a couple times to reroute blood flow because of a birth defect.) I've always been on high alert, but before then, I've never went to an ER before. After being there for hours on end doing all the tests they could. They came to the conclusion that I had a severe panic attack caused by stress or anxiety. So I was holding onto stress and anxiety since I've been a little kid. I always wanted to be strong for my parents and friends and show no fear. Never talked about how I felt before that event. Now at 35 I am relatively stress free. I work on my anxiety everyday though. Whether it be meditation, eating right, or just going to therapist to talk things out. \n\nThat panic attack felt so much like a heart attack though I can't describe the feeling but it was scary and I felt like I had minutes till a bomb was gonna go off in my chest. My only advice would be to keep talking about how you feel. Scared, anxious, depressed, happy, all of them. Might want to see if a therapist will help. I know it would have helped me at your age.

The open heart surgery was a major success. While I do have low oxygen saturation I maintain a health lifestyle with yoga, meditation, and jogs. I'm weight restricted so I don't do weight training. Lots of resistance training. I'm sure we all have similar situations but each of us is different. I complain about fatigue and being tired but I'm not without the idea of how luck and fortunate I've been. I now have a full team of doctors that see me a cardiac  thoracic surgeon being one of them that I get to talk to. I also pick each of their brains about our condition and ways I can improve my quality of life. I was born in the right place at the right time. I absolutely know how lucky I am and I know there are people that are suffering or aren't getting the best treatment like I am.",1615730595,t1_gqw40qz,/r/chd/comments/m2ebiu/people_dont_understand_us_fontaners/gqwc2xb/
gqd2cdv,m1apzu,"Hey! It sounds like you need to talk to your doctor again. It sounds like your health has recently worsened and it‚Äôs (understandably) causing you some pretty significant stress. We can‚Äôt really offer any medical advice because we aren‚Äôt your doctors. \n\nCongenital heart disease can certainly present itself in adulthood, but there are other (far more common) things that could be the underlying cause of your symptoms, for example anaemia. Your adderall could explain some of your blood pressure changes too. \n\nSo I would go back to your primary care physician. It could be helpful to keep a health diary, where you record your blood pressure and pulse. I would also suggest asking for a full blood count if your doctor doesn‚Äôt (but they will probably order it automatically based on your symptoms).

The tachycardia and low BPs could be indicative of something of this nature. I definitely think you should see your PCP for an evaluation first to see if you should see a cardiologist. \n\nI will say, we have had older patients come in with issues they never knew they had, so it is possible. However, it is impossible to say without a doctor going through all of this information and thoroughly examining you. \n\nGood luck.

But I suspect if you have it, and it's bad enough to cause the symptoms you're describing, someone should be able to put their ear to your chest and hear more of a ""whoosh"" where there's normally a ""thump"". Hopefully someone who knows more can confirm or deny this.\n\nI was born with bicuspid aortic stenosis, and they noticed it when I was an infant. For me, it was a gradual worsening that they tracked throughout my childhood; I was always a bit slower than my peers and by time I was 15 it was bad enough to operate.

Heart health is obviously a lot more serious than the ability to focus, and I know the doctor first say to stop taking it. It‚Äôs nice on my stress levels to hear that  this being congenital is unlikely.

gqdecdu,m1apzu,"Thanks so much for the input! POTS definitely sounds plausible, as the constant low bp and prolonged super increase in hr with standing are signs something up with the orthostatic response. I‚Äôm also the prime demographic that would be affected by this. \n\nIve done a bit of research about it but I‚Äôm still pretty confused; do you normally see POTS as the primary cause for issues like this? There‚Äôs not too many research articles on it, so I was curious whether it can occur as a result of other things. I seem to have many additional symptoms of it such as chronic migraines and stomach issues, but those both reduced in frequency when I stopped eating gluten. \n\nBesides congenital aortic stenosis or POTS, the only other option I could think of is rheumatic heart disease resulting in mitral valve stenosis. While this would fit the timeline and my symptoms pretty well, I‚Äôm not quite sure how plausible it is. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in the US and I was never diagnosed with it. Looking at my old medical records, however, I was sick all the time and had a fairly decent amount of positive strep tests as a young child. When I was 7, I was sick with scarlet fever for several days before going to the clinic. I had a relatively high pain tolerance, but around this time frame (ages 7-9ish) I recall getting agonizing growing pains. My family kept a very detailed daily planner, and I know my memories aren‚Äôt exaggerating because my siblings would write comments in it about how I was screaming all night or complaining all day about joint pain. \n\nDo you believe it‚Äôs possible that those growing pains and frequent illnesses were rheumatic fever? I can‚Äôt pinpoint other exact symptoms and I don‚Äôt know much about how severe or noticeable rheumatic fever can be. A better way to ask that is probably: have you ever seen a patient get diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in which they were unaware they ever had rheumatic fever? \n\nAnd last question: Would the damage from rheumatic heart disease lower QRS voltage on an ECG? The low QRS is the result in having the hardest time finding an explanation for! \n\nSorry that was so long and again, thanks so much for the help! :) Getting an appointment with a cardiologist takes a while but I will definitely try to schedule now. I love learning about this kind of stuff, and the input you‚Äôve given me has helped clear some stuff up!",1615323153,t1_gqd1u2l,/r/chd/comments/m1apzu/19f_could_congenital_aortic_stenosis_been_dormant/gqdecdu/
gqcr5yx,m1apzu,"Thanks for your response!! I hope the surgery worked out well for you and that things are better now!\n\nI did read congenital aortic stenosis could be asymptomatic for a long time, but I do agree that it would be very strange to not really have symptoms as a child. That‚Äôs the main thing that makes me believe I‚Äôm either paranoid or this could be something else! As for the heart murmur- I am not sure. From what I understand, I would‚Äôve always had a murmur. If the valve issue was very minor as a child though, maybe it could have been very quiet and almost undetectable? I did apparently have a murmur as a child but it was extremely quiet and not distinct. Children often have harmless murmurs so if it was quiet and indistinct, wouldn‚Äôt raise any red flags. As for now- I cannot remember the last time a doctor listened to my heart. Even when I got my ECG a while back, she just listened to my lungs. \n\nNow, I am not very familiar with murmurs but when I feel my heart now, the two beats (lub-dub) are not very distinct. Kinda just feels like one vibrating mess, or two kinda beats with like fuzziness in the middle. Again, this is just what I feel with my hand and I haven‚Äôt listened with a stethoscope. With your heart murmur, can you kind of feel it with your hand? I would ask somebody to listen but I don‚Äôt want to distress my mom (she gets extreme anxiety over this stuff) over it unless I‚Äôm certain.",1615312589,t1_gqcopym,/r/chd/comments/m1apzu/19f_could_congenital_aortic_stenosis_been_dormant/gqcr5yx/

gqdvlo9,m1apzu,"I'm glad to have helped! I have only seen heart function decrease from viral illnesses and they are usually super acute. Like endocarditis. Rheumatic heart disease sounds farfetched to me, but you never know. I think seeing your pcp and then a cardiologist is your best bet. I am not overly sure about the low voltage result on the EKG, but an EKG is such a small snapshot of time, it doesn't mean much. A 24+ hour Holter monitor is a better indication of arrhythmias and consistent irregularities. An EKG is limited. A Holter + an echo tells you much more.\n\nI have never seen POTS, but have read about it because it is fascinating. \n\nMy best advice is to see a cardiologist with a super open-minded perspective. Your pcp is a good place to start, though. They know you best and can do blood work and order other tests in their scope as well as a cardiology referral if needed.",1615331046,t1_gqdecdu,/r/chd/comments/m1apzu/19f_could_congenital_aortic_stenosis_been_dormant/gqdvlo9/

I think the audible would be important. I understand why your mom can't do it, but do you have a sibling or another friend who would be willing to try?\n\nIf you're having abnormal rhythms and there were noticeable abnormalities on your EKG, I'd think it's worth an echocardiogram either way.

gqdj06j,m1apzu,"Glad to hear you‚Äôre doing well now! :)\n\nI think you‚Äôre probably right that a doctor would‚Äôve investigated a murmur more. The murmur I had a a child was so slight and probably was not even audible at all my appointments. Harmless murmurs are pretty common in kids, so if I wasn‚Äôt stressing about my symptoms now, I wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about it. My siblings sadly do not possess the skill of discretion, but I can ask my friend to listen over the weekend. Considering you actually know you have a murmur and still couldn‚Äôt really feel it, I think my own confirmation bias probably had an impact. It becomes easier to see or feel symptoms that aren‚Äôt there because I‚Äôm nervous.  \n\nMy PCP wanted me to come in for some blood work in about a month to monitor a few things. I think I‚Äôll try and get that scheduled as early as I can now and see if she can hear a murmur. I think if my blood panels and vitamin tests all come back fairly normal, an echocardiogram would be the next step.

gqk1poz,m1apzu,"Oh not at all! Every bit of advice helps, but I can definitely see your point. It‚Äôs probably common for people become fixating on a suspecting diagnosis/idea of what they have, in this case ‚Äúwow must be a CHD‚Äù. I guess in my case, I really feel, after reading so many research articles, that mitral valve stenosis best explains all the symptoms and results (ECG). Timeline and causes however are far harder to find data on, so in this case anecdotal evidence is my next bet. When I see my PCP and a cardiologist, I will keep a very open mind:). After all, cardiovascular issues can have a very variety of causes, where often heart involvement can be secondary. My age and general history make a lot of the more usual suspects less likely however, so I figured if the primary cause is actually heart related, the people here would be my best bet for input or suggesting something I haven‚Äôt yet come across in research. \n\nReally though, I‚Äôm hyper curious and like to be well informed before I go to the Dr so I can communicate more effectively.

So where I live as a student, going to an ER and getting diagnostics run there is fast and free (whereas if I wanted to see a specialist it would take months). Bought a decent stethoscope, listened to my heart and heard a quiet murmur that was most audible in mitral area. I had already had mitral stenosis as my highest suspicion prior to this so I was decently certain at this point. \n\nI knew my BP and heart rate would be weird enough for the ER people to immediately order an ECG. It showed similar but more obvious results as my prior ecg, such as arrhythmia and weird p waves, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and low QRS voltage across all leads. On my prior ecg p waves werent even noted by the technician; I only saw the slight p mitrale bc we were learning how to read ecgs in my cardiology class. So anyways, they took some blood and did an echo and yeah, low potassium and moderate mitral stenosis. \n\nWhile I‚Äôll have to watch the stenosis, I THINK that many of my bad symptoms were from the low potassium! I‚Äôm pretty sure now that my symptoms only got worse when I started taking Adderall because I was eating so little from the appetite suppression. \n\nHopefully the the K pills now fix it and the new banana regimen i plan on implementing could prevent this from getting bad again.

For your second surgery they most likely used the bone saw. Then they carefully cut your heart out of your body and then began cutting, suturing, cutting, placing, suturing again for several hours. My son had a PA band at 4 weeks old and a Glenn/DKS at 9 months old. You were in pain no matter what they tell you.

I was born in 1991, had my first surgery in 97 and second in 2005. The first surgery was scary, but I was very young still and didn‚Äôt understand the scope of what was happening. The second had more complications and was much more traumatic. I imagine it must feel strange to not remember anything, but honestly you aren‚Äôt missing anything. The recovery is rough. CHD treatment has come a long way since the 90‚Äôs, so your best bet is to stay on top of your cardiology follow ups with a doctor who specializes in adult CHD. This is so key. I didn‚Äôt find an adult CHD specialist until I was in my late twenties and honestly she has changed my life and lifted so much anxiety for me.

Hell, after my surgery I had to buy new foundation because I was less waxy/pale all the time. Not even kidding. What I perceived as normal was *not normal*, and all the doctors I saw focused on if things were changing for me, not if my actual baseline was okay.\n\nSimilarly, my daughter's CHD was diagnosed only after I was really insistent on having her seen by a pediatric cardiologist despite her symptoms not being ""that bad."" She had a substantial ASD (<1mm or so of wall on either side) but she wouldn't have even seen a doctor without our really pushing.

gn0zpsi,lhk7gi,"I believe ventricular inversion is another term for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) and also known as levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA). Let me know if you are referring to something else. This condition occurs in about 1 in 30,000 births. I believe the majority of people born with this have other heart defect(s), with the most common being VSD, specifically a membranous VSD.  Pulmonary stenosis is also pretty common with this and a VSD and can sometimes be beneficial (before surgery) because it can slow down some of the extra blood flow from the VSD. I'm not sure how common double outlet right ventricle is with these conditions. The size and location of a VSD might have an effect on getting this diagnosis as well because it can be hard to determine which ventricle the arteries are originating from. \n\nMy daughter has all of these conditions and is also situs inversus so all of her organs are on the opposite side as they normally are. Her cardiologist who has been practicing for 30+ years has only seen one other similar case about 20 years ago. I'm not sure if he was referring to the other case as being similar because of the combination of ccTGA and situs inversus or her other defects. I do know that his other patient was still living. \n\nI would try not to get caught up on how rare it is. Two children with the same diagnosis may have completely different treatment plans and outcomes. It really depends on the severity of each and how they relate to one another. So, don't get too caught up on the statistics. However, I love statistics and found out something crazy this week.  Someone who lives a few houses down from me has a daughter who has ccTGA and situs inversus. The combination of those two are probably around 1 in 100,000 and we live maybe 200 yards from each other.

That said...what entities exist that the general public could donate time/resources (money) to, to actually have them feel meritous of these resources aside from children‚Äôs heart foundation? I do not ask to troll. I ask as a CHD survivor because even I don‚Äôt know. If this is the only one then it feels incumbent upon that entity to reach out and get these sports franchises and leagues on board. If not them then someone else (or group) to step up. \n\nThen there is the daunting task of where do those funds actually go? R&D? To underserved families where a child has CHD? Underserved communities that show higher numbers of patients? \n\nAgain I agree to the fullest there needs to be more awareness.

gks2xpn,l52ghu,"I was actually the patient many years ago for open heart surgery to close my ASD, but I guess a child‚Äôs view of the experience could help.\n\nThey told me that they were going to put a patch on my heart to fix the hole since it hasn‚Äôt closed on its own after several years. The surgery was scheduled early in the morning so I could wake up at a decent time of the day, luckily that also made not hungry from fasting the night before.\n\nWhen I woke up I wasn‚Äôt in pain (they obviously make sure you‚Äôre on pain meds after a major surgery) and they had me walk around almost immediately after (at least from how I remember it since it was almost 14 years ago). They had me stay their for several days to monitor me and since I was in a pediatric hospital, everyone was kind to me mostly saying: ‚ÄúI was a brave kid for going into surgery‚Äù\n\nI was actually able to go home early from how well I was doing. After ‚Äúresting‚Äù at home (don‚Äôt expect a child to do absolutely nothing while recovering) for awhile, the school had me sit out of gym class even if the activity was minor for an elementary school‚Äôs gym class.\n\nSurprisingly taking out my stitches wasn‚Äôt that painful. I felt them pluck them out but I don‚Äôt remember being in pain from it afterwards.\n\nSince you said it‚Äôs an ASD device closure I‚Äôll also share my experience with a cardiac catheter. I had one as a baby, but I actually had another diagnostic cardiac catheter 2 years ago. \n\nAlthough I‚Äôm an adult now, my cardiologist is actually a pediatric cardiologist that also works with adults with congenital heart defects. We decided that I should get an MRI and heart catheter to get more information on my heart condition and to see if there was anything else causing me heart issues other than my defects.\n\nTheir was some confusion at first since I‚Äôm an adult in the pediatric section for the heart catheter, mostly from wether or not I was getting sedated. Someone in the office thought that I wasn‚Äôt getting sedated since I was an adult but my cardiologist said otherwise before. They clearer it up when the catheterization team said I was scheduled to be sedated but I could ultimately choose wether or not I was going to.\n\nI opted to be sedated since I didn‚Äôt know if I could willingly keep my leg still for long while knowing that their was a tube in their going to my heart.\n\nOnce I woke up, I felt slightly tired afterwards but their main concern was that I shouldn‚Äôt move my leg. My family‚Äôs plan was to get lunch afterwards, but it turned into a longer process since they had to slowly sit me up over the course of several hours to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt bleed out. They told me that they had some type of closure device in my leg to keep it from bleeding that would dissolve in several weeks (I had a pamphlet for it but I can‚Äôt remember the name of it). Despite some pain at the site, I did fine overall (the only problem I had was feeling that I needed to crack my leg after I got home, but I figured it would be a bad idea since it would irritate the wound).\n\nOverall for both procedures I was nervous at first but I just went to sleep and slowly woke up after each procedure and felt fine. I didn‚Äôt seem to have side effects from the anesthesia other than feeling tired.\n\nGood luck to both of you!",1611627407,t3_l52ghu,/r/chd/comments/l52ghu/deleted_by_user/gks2xpn/

They originally spoke of closing around 3, but she is especially small so they decided to let her grow until she was ""big enough"" for a device closure versus open heart surgery. She has never had any symptoms that we can directly attribute to it. She has complained from time to time about her chest/heart hurting after running a lot or saying she has difficult breathing, but she is now also aware that her heart is being fixed soon and is a little has a little hypochondria- haha!

Our daughter was born with a similar condition, but with two key differences compared to your son's case: she had stenosis, not atresia, but unfortunately the ventricle (although it had a good structure) it was still quite underdeveloped, about a third of the size that it should have. The plan was also to open the valve to allow or stimulate growth of the ventricle. However, the small size of the ventricle was still a problem. Therefore, the doctors felt that they had to add a shunt and allow blood flow to the lungs.\n\nDo they plan something similar in your case, or a shunt will not be needed?\n\nBased on your message, and as your son's ventricle has developed to mostly normal size (yeah!!!)

Waking up with a breathing tube and the removal process were no picnic. Also, my face was really swollen for some reason so I couldn't open my eyes at first.

However, I had a medical history of atrial fibrillation before surgery and unfortunately surgery fired it up again, so I didn't fully recover until Oct., when I had a cardioversion to get it under control.

gh9po7w,khykoj,"I'd say the direct pain from the wound wasn't that bad after 4 months, but I definitely felt a lot of stiffness in my back and shoulders from all those weeks of being inactive. I would recommend trying to maintain some flexibility by stretching once you feel comfortable doing some passive exercises (I didn't, and I regretted it). I struggled a lot with my core stability after the surgery, especially squatting or deadlifting - and I guess that must be pretty important for climbing? Single leg lunge and squat variations really helped me with that, along with core exercises like planks and dead bugs.\n\n5 months sounds reasonable, but I think it's also important to consider the stress on your body if you ever slip (does a harness catch you?), the climbing itself shouldn't be too hard to get used to again. It took about 7 or 8 months before I felt like I was at 80% or so of my previous strength - my chest has never really felt the same, but maybe it's just a mental thing.\n\nI also started taking blood thinners after the surgery, so maybe that slowed down my progress, not too sure.

I had an initial surgery when I was 4 months old to correct most of the ToF complications. I was never an athletic kid, but I didn't really notice any symptoms in particular that prevented me from being athletic. I just didn't like exercising.\n\nThe pulmonary valve replacement I had right before high school was very helpful and improved my heart function a lot, but I don't think I actually noticed a difference in how I felt physically. I also didn't really have much pain after surgery and never filled my oxycotin prescription. I was just very fatigued for a week or two. I also had about 6 weeks of not being allowed to carry more than 10 lbs I think. I couldn't bring my violin to school either because it weighed too much in the case, but I was allowed to play it after 4 weeks.\n\nMaybe 5 years ago I had to have an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) placed for some rhythm issues I was having. I'm not paced with it normally, but I had a few times in 2019 where it's prevented me from having a full on heart attack by pacing me out of a bad rhythm.\n\nSince the ICD placement I had a Pulmonary ablation in 2019 to help with the rhythm issues and things have been pretty good. I am more active now (well, before Covid) than I was growing up. I've been perfectly fine playing ultimate Frisbee and rock climbing (other than the rhythm issues) and hiking. Since my ablation my rhythm issues have gone away :)\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about any of that",1610860364,t1_gizj6di,/r/chd/comments/khpti8/interview_request_chd_patients_with_pulmonary/gjjpqsj/

gg4tq5k,ketk6o,"Yes. My daughter is currently 2 - but she‚Äôs been diagnosed as having moderate to severe autism. They said that it‚Äôs not uncommon for autistic children to have cardiac issues at all when we saw her developmental pediatrician. \n\nMy daughter acted almost typical except not eating. She was tube fed for the first year of her life. Then around 14 months it‚Äôs like something happened. She stopped meeting milestones, stopped making eye contact, started regressing. Its hard to say why it all happened... I still look at pictures from her before anything went different. It‚Äôs like the look in her eyes in the pictures are so happy and there. And now she won‚Äôt look for pictures, it‚Äôs a struggle to get any eye contact, and it‚Äôs just hard. It makes me cry sometimes when I see it. Even in her face there‚Äôs a difference. She‚Äôs still very happy - but it‚Äôs like in her eyes she‚Äôs not the baby she was. It‚Äôs hard to explain. It keeps me up at night sometimes honestly. I have a lot of stress about her future and a lot of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions. Like I had the flu when I was in my first trimester - and I had it BAD - I know that‚Äôs when their hearts are developing and there‚Äôs a lot of things forming and I always wonder if I wasn‚Äôt sick would this all have happened? I got my flu shot that year, I took all the precautions I could. But unfortunately I also work in healthcare and was exposed. The fevers I had for two weeks were horrible and even Tylenol didn‚Äôt keep them down. But yeah.. that‚Äôs one of those mind games that I have now. \n\nIf you have any questions I‚Äôll gladly answer them.

ggoihpz,ketk6o,"I couldn't read this & not leave you an Internet hug. I'm a CHD adult who is Autistic. I promise you, nothing you did or didn't do caused it: autism is genetic. If you look around at your family members & analyse them a little, I have no doubt you'll start to notice autistic traits that you hadn't realised existed as a collection before. It's highly likely that yourself & /or your little ones dad are neurodivergent too. Mothers are a group who is suddenly surging in diagnoses, because we are taking our children to be diagnosed & the medical field now recognises the genetic element: so many people I know have been told, ""And you too by the way,"" by their paediatricians.\n\nIt's not on you. And having a parent who knows she's autistic will make the world of difference, I promise. My parents didn't k ow & at 39 I have so many answers about myself I wish I'd had long ago. I am very open & clear with my two children about our neurology (yep, all of us - me, their dad, both sets of grandparents, their auntie...).\n\nMy daughter was always reasonably non-fjssed about human interaction. She's a bit like a cat - she likes you there for food & cuddles on her terms, but other than that, she's pretty self sufficient. My son was the puppy - bouncy, happy, so cuddly his nickname was Limpetboy as a small. I too felt the 'loss' of him around 2-5. I thought that child was gone.\n\nBut as he's come through the developmental stages of that age (some behind, some not), he's turned into such a well-balanced 10yo. This morning he woke me up, saw I was tired, & dragged his double duvet through to the lounge for me so he could play Minecraft while I wrapped myself up on the couch & chatted to him. Sometimes he's so hyperfocussed he won't say a word: others he does not stop for breath. He's far from his Limpetboy days, but he's the 'normal' level of cuddly & chatty now.\n\nHang in there mama.

If I were you and wanted to be worry free about passing any sort of heart problems to future kids, I would setup an appointment with a geneticist, your heart doctor, and probably a psychologist. You can get your DNA checked out by the geneticist to see if you have any warning markers that would carry over to future offspring. Your heart doctor might be able to shed more light on how your exact heart problem will affect future children. And you should absolutely talk this out with a professional because as you know, living with chd can throw you tons of curve balls and it's extremely beneficial to have your mind and body in as relatively best shape as you can be.

I was born with hypoplastic right heart syndrome, and had my first open heart surgery around the age of 4 as well. Fontan revision at 15 so another open heart surgery. Lastly I had a heart transplant 4 years ago, so I also have a full zipper. With my heart transplant my donor heart was a little too big so they had to take the top of my sternum out just for it to fit. I had to have skin grafts for them to close my chest. I guess over time and with movement and me gaining weight the wires moved around. The one that was poking me was actually fractured. You could even see it poking through, it looked like a little bump under my skin right bellow the center of my collarbone. When I first noticed it and it didnt go away I made an appointment with my cardiologist/transplant team, they discovered through a chest xray that it was a fractured wire and I had it removed within a month. It‚Äôs a pretty simple procedure, they went in through my previous scar to pull the wires out and it only took me a couple weeks to recover. They took out the fractured wire and a couple other wires that I didn‚Äôt really need anymore because my chest was already closed. So I recommend you get them checked out and hopefully you‚Äôll be able to get them removed. They ended up removing them so quickly because they didn‚Äôt want the wires to cause any more damage.

They took him to the children's hospital.  He was fairly stable by the time they got to the ER.  So yesterday he had a G tube implanted and a nissen wrap.  He is currently at the hospital with my wife.  Unfortunately during this pandemic, only one of us parents can visit him at a time.

gddnl2z,jzr9bu,"While I don‚Äôt have any experience with your particular situation, I do know what it is like to experience a pregnancy where you find out about a CHD. \n\nWe found out at a scan around 28 weeks that our daughter has a rare CHD called tricuspid valve dysplasia, so blood on the right side of her heart backflows into the atria because the valve doesn‚Äôt close all the way. \n\nI understand what you mean when you say your world was rocked, as ours was too. I tried to learn as much information as I could about our daughters diagnosis, and of course google is not helpful. The stats google gave basically told us our daughter wouldn‚Äôt make it. \n\nFunny enough, our daughter had heart surgery at 9 days old and it wasn‚Äôt even for her initial CHD, they found a different one after her birth. She‚Äôs 8 months old now and hasn‚Äôt needed any intervention for her initial CHD. I think she had a VSD too that her cardio has been following. \n\nAnyways, what I learned from our experience is that everything was much much scarier when she was in my belly. We had echos every other week, and I grit my teeth in each one because I was so nervous. Once she was delivered, everything wasn‚Äôt nearly as ominous. Even when she needed heart surgery, I was nervous but knew that things were moving forward and that she would recover and that eventually we would take her home, etc. \n\nIt‚Äôs okay to ask as many questions as possible, even questions that you don‚Äôt even know. Doctors can be so quick with these things that they aren‚Äôt always aware what it‚Äôs like to be sitting on the other side of the ‚Äútable‚Äù.

I was also told I wouldn‚Äôt live long without a transplant so I was put on the list and had to wait 4 years until my transplant (I ran into some complications while on the transplant list).

With my fontan my quality of life was very poor which was the reason why I decided to go ahead with transplant. It‚Äôs mainly all up to you, if you want to have a risky and painful procedure that could increase your quality of life then I say go for it like I did or if you are fine with the way things are then you should keep things as you are. There might also be alternative treatments available for you, my transplant was about 4 years ago so there might be other options now.

This is my own experience and I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to find someone more knowledgeable than me, but I hope my experience can help. Some of this would depend on whether this is your situation or your child‚Äôs situation.

Also, I know they were able to purchase a whole life plan from a financial planner. I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend this, for a variety of reasons, but the underlying theme from both was that no physical was required.\n\nAdulthood: That no physical part plays into how I got insurance when I started working in my career. My employer offers life insurance with no medical examine. It‚Äôs based on tiered pricing and is more expensive than term policies, but still worth it to offer protection for my family. It‚Äôs not term technically but will function  as such until I drop it at retirement. At that point I basically need to be self insured, i.e. retirement savings, owned home, cash in the bank. The policy price goes up every so many years so eventually it‚Äôs to pricey to carry but it covers us until I have enough assets and my family doesn‚Äôt need the coverage. I tried going through a company once but was rejected despite no difference in my mortality risk.

As you are trying to get an appointment with your cardiologist, I recommend keeping a journal and logging when you feel anything out of the ordinary, what you were doing, etc.\n\nI also recommend doing the following:\n\n- Every morning weigh yourself**** write down what your weight was. Major fluctuations in weight can be a sign of edema (water retention) which can be a sign of CHF\n\n- Monitor fluid input vs. output. Small output but major input can be a sign of water retention, or your kidneys not functions correctly which can be a sign of CHF\n\n- Monitor your salt intake. \n\n- Check your ankles, legs, feet, calves, and thighs to see if you are retaining any fluid. Recommended to do this throughout the day AND at the end of the day when you finally get off your feet. There are many ways to do this. I take two fingers and press the top of my foot down, count to three, and then lift my fingers up and see if there is an indentation. I do the same for on top of my ankles, behind my angles, side of my calf, and thighs. Edema is common with heart failure, and this would be a way to monitor.\n\n- Have someone check to see if you may have jugular vein distention (which would look like a bulging large blue vein on the side of your neck. There are several instructional videos and how-to sites on how to do this). JVD is an indication of excessive pressure which can be a sign of CHF.\n\n- When you lay down, make note of how many pillows you sleep on. Do you sleep flat? Do you even need a pillow? Is it more comfortable to breathe with 2 or more pillows? Do you have to be slightly sitting up? Pulmonary edema makes it difficult to breathe while laying flat, and can be a sign of CHF.\n\nI know this is a lot, but I was super lucky enough (*cough*) to experience ALL the symptoms above.",1603201414,t3_j6mkgx,/r/chd/comments/j6mkgx/pulmonary_valve_stenosis/g9fk23b/

g5jfnxd,iu6vvk,"Hello! Fellow fontan patient, currently 26, also female. I was born with pulmonary and tricuspid atresia, along with dextracardia. I had my fontan put in when I was four years old and then I had a revision at fifteen, where they just put a new, bigger fontan in and some stents as well i believe. Unfortunately even the new fontan gave me swelling in my gut, and sometimes my legs and ankles. I also used to have palpitations and low oxygen levels because of it. I managed for few years with diuretics (meds that make you pee), albumin(protein) and ivig(immunoglobulins) infusions monthly and oxygen at night, but ultimately got a heart transplant in 2016. I waited on and off the list for four years, which is probably more than usual because my case was very complicated. But I‚Äôve been healthy ever since. I live in California, went to UCLA for my surgeries. \n\nI think with time and you growing that fontans can cause circulation probelms and it might need to be replaced.

gfnnei2,isgn66,"Hi, I have absolutely no idea why this subreddit was recommended to me as I dont have congenital heart disease, bizarrely though im a PA for a Cardiologist who specialises in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (he takes over your care when you reach 16 and are too old for Paediatric Cardiology. I also work for a Cardiologist who specialises in heart failure and an Interventional Cardiologist and have done so for almost 25 years. With regards to your atrial fibrillation, have you not been offered DC cardioverion or RFA? Do you take anti-coagulants? Do you know what your CHA2DS2 vasc score is, especially if you have AF and mitral valve disease. I didnt notice your age so it may be irrelevant. I assume WPW is Wolfe Parkinson White syndrome, PAC's and PVC's are paroxysmal atrial couplets and ventricular couplets? Do you take a beta-blocker? I know if ectopic beats etc are troublesome, and you dont want to take medication everyday for something thats paroxysmal, you could ask the Cardiologist if you could have ""a pill in your pocket"" which you basically just take on an "" as and when required basis"" if things are really bothering you that day.\n\nAs for your mitral valve stenosis, as you know there isn't really anything you can do to reverse this or prevent it. You should probably have a yearly echocardiogram just to keep an eye on it. Valve replacements have come a long way, with many being done trans-catheter rather than cracking your chest open but I doubt you have to worry about that for many decades, if at all. The best thing you can do is to keep your heart as healthy as possible and try not to worry about it, as this can just exacerbate your symptoms. Obviously im not a Cardiologist and your own doctor will know best, just really wanted to tell you to try not to worry too much.

He wasn't a candidate for the switch operation. The plan was to have the BT shunt to allow him to grow and hopefully do the rastelli, to allow him to have 1.5 ventricles. Midway through the Rastelli he had to have the Glenn instead due to the severe stenosis on the one side. So he then had the fontan about 2 years after that and officially became single ventricle. \nBut to answer your question,  yes.

So the anxiety was actually causing what he thought were palpitations.\n\nThe chest pains he‚Äôs complained about over the years have also turned out to be nothing dangerous. Sometimes the cartilage that attaches your rib bone to the chest bone can become a little tender and cause pain (Costochondritis). But you need to be checked out by your doctor to determine that.  \n\nIt‚Äôs always good to have these things checked out. If it‚Äôs nothing, you‚Äôll feel better. Even if it is palpitations, there‚Äôs lots that can be done. Either way, getting it checked out will make you feel better.\n\nAs for having anxiety and bad thoughts, I think it‚Äôs normal for anyone who has gone through medical procedures.

Heart transplant can drastically improve the liver, but has its own issues as I‚Äôm sure you are aware, not the least of which is the surgery involved.\n\nI would say you should ask your cardiologist straight questions. Some questions I would like my patient to ask me are:\n- Am I doing everything I can to keep my liver and my heart healthy?\n- Is there any medication for my heart that can take some stress off my liver? Sometimes blood pressure medications or medications that reduce the blood pressure in the lungs (like sildenafil) may help.\n- When should I realistically start thinking more about heart transplant?\n\nHope some of this helps!",1599104141,t3_il3lqs,/r/chd/comments/il3lqs/liver_disease_experience/g3t0yc0/

g0ze2e9,i3xfd5,"Hey there! \n\nI am twenty-six (I turn twenty-seven in October), and I just underwent my second OHS a week ago. \n\nMy thoughts: \n\n1. Mechanical valve absolutely. I cannot second this enough. My first AVR was biological. They tend not to last as long in younger patients (about ten to fifteen years). I got eight out of mine before it needed to be replaced last week. Overall, it was nice not being on blood thinning medications, and maybe at eighteen years old this was the best, but now that I'm in my mid-to-late twenties, I really don't mind the restrictions versus the longevity. You will want to talk to your cardiologist/surgeon, as the blood thinners may significantly impact some of your hiking activities. This will be something for you to ultimately decide on. I can only tell you as someone looking back though, part of me wishes I had just gone mechanical at first. What can ya say though. I was stubborn about it. ;) \n\n2. Maybe I'll update you if I find something more specific? Unfortunately, it's a bit harder for people like us, as having open heart surgery between twenty and forty is not commonplace. From what I saw though, the rates of longevity with a mechanical AVR are pretty good though. While a lot of patients are older, it's also a lot better studied, because a mechanical aortic valve is ""the way to go"" in most cases, and it has been for a long time. I was also a candidate for the Ross Procedure in my most recent operation, but I eventually decided against it. My surgeon was willing to transfer my care to Mount Sinai in New York, which does the most Ross Procedures in the world, but I wasn't a fan of all of the unknowns I'd be facing. So far, I'm incredibly happy with my decision to stay at UChicago for my mechanical valve replacement. \n\n3. Biggest things: It hurts. I won't BS you and say it doesn't. That said, it's worth it. Even my last operation, which only gave me eight years between this operation, I was ecstatic to think of the trade; the discomfort only lasts a couple of months really. The extra time is amazing. It's a gift. I won't get pushy on you, as I'm recently more religious, but the life is worth cherishing. (I was actually an agnostic atheist until the last few months, so don't feel bad.) You aren't fully healed for a year or so afterward, but you definitely feel a lot better by three months out or so. The first time was a biological valve replacement, so I will say I felt totally normal post recovery until a few months ago. When I needed a new valve replacement again, I could definitely tell. Lots of shortness of breath and some jaundice. (My blood cells were dying too as a result, so this explains the jaundice.) With this most recent operation and the mechanical valve, you hear it ticking! It's weird at first. Really weird. It's still a bit weird, but you start to get used to it. Also, bruising may be more commonplace with blood thinners. I am bruised a bit where the IVs and lines were. This is something you'll want to discuss with hiking. Again, I think the best course of action would honestly be to accept the mechanical aortic valve and change your lifestyle, but this is your decision and up to you to discuss with your doctors. \n\n4. So my first AVR, I became diabetic. Really weird. I didn't have any symptoms of pre-diabetes, but I was out of shape, and I am half Hispanic, so I have those boxes checked against me. My most recent surgery, I have gone mostly good, but I still have some mild numbness in my legs. I can use the muscles totally still, so I don't think it's any lasting nerve damage, but according to some of the surgical team, I still have a week or so to regain feeling totally lol. It's not like a total numbness. Some muscles and parts of my legs are tingly but still work. Just emphasizing you probably don't want to do this a second time if you don't have to. Otherwise, this most recent time, I also had to get a chest tube a second time for one of my lungs. Do not recommend, but obviously you aren't choosing if your lungs want to cooperate. It hurts, but again, I'm alive, and I'm so grateful sitting here a week out, laying in bed and at home. \n\nOverall, it's a tough journey. I won't say it's not. That said, it is so worth it as someone who is going through it all a second time. If you have any other questions or want to chat more, I'm always open.",1597057390,t3_i3xfd5,/r/chd/comments/i3xfd5/adult_now_42_with_update_to_aortic_stenosis_and/g0ze2e9/
g4becaf,i3xfd5,"Hi!\n\n41 yo here. I had aortic and pulmonary valve replacement + ascending aorta replacement last year and, after careful consideration and a million talks with the surgeons (who recommended mechanical) I ended up choosing biological valves. The restrictions to my lifestyle and plans (specially in regards to my months-long backpacking trips) that a mechanical valve would require + the ticking (double in my case) were not something I was willing to endure, at least not at such a young age.\n\nI know I'm an odd one, though. ‚úåüèº\n\nRegarding recovery and complications, the first week went really smoothly. Lots of back muscle pain the first 24 h though, probably from having had my sternum cracked open üòÖ, but I was already walking like an old lady by the fourth day. I developed atrial fibrillation during the second week, which is something that can happen, specially because I'd already had it before so it's unlikely (though possible) that it was surgery related.\n\nI was released on the 15th day and had physical therapy for a month, but recovery was slow due to the afib. Finally got the afib sorted properly 6 months later and I've been fine as a fiddle since.\n\nThe downside: they damaged my laryngeal nerve during surgery so I ended with vocal cord paresis and lost a big part of my voice. This is a rare complication, though, I was extremely unlucky. \n\nDespite all this, I'd still go with the biological valves. Voice notwithstanding, I am able to lead the exact same life I've always led, but with better stamina. No dietary restrictions, tricky travel plans or being tied down to weekly (at first) coagulation tests or the fear of stroke. I wouldn't trade that right now; I chose to have another 10ish years of getting my kicks (damn you, covid!) before considering the alternative.",1599470644,t3_i3xfd5,/r/chd/comments/i3xfd5/adult_now_42_with_update_to_aortic_stenosis_and/g4becaf/

I would have panic attacks about everything, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder so that might have nothing to do with my heart.\n\nIt was and still is worth it.\n\nMy advice:\n1. Make sure you go to Disability Services and fill out any paperwork you need. This will be helpful in the future.\n2. Email all of your professors as soon as you can to tell them about your health issues. In my experience, professors are more than willing to be flexible if you are proactive.\n3. Keep your course load to the minimum you need. For me this meant 6 units to be a full time student for financial aid reasons.\n4. Try to have your classes on the same day. I had many semesters where I only went to classes two days a week and it helped me A LOT.\n5. Make sure you have breaks between your classes. I usually set up my semesters so I had a class before noon, a two hour break, and then an afternoon class. This may mean you are on campus all day, but this way you‚Äôll have multiple breaks throughout the day.\n6. Number 4 and 5 together were some of my best semesters where I achieved my best grades.\n7.

fzxrfw9,i1iv7t,"Hi, I‚Äôd listen to your cardiologist. It sounds like you have very little to worry about. Bicuspid aortic valves are the most common congenital heart defect. Unfortunately, they present to varying degrees, so your cardiologist is the most qualified to calm your concerns.. but I‚Äôll try. Essentially the valve doesn‚Äôt open all the way. That leads to turbulent flow, which is what most doctors keep and eye on (stenosis). As a result of that flow, the large vessel beyond the valve sometimes dilates. *Everyone* (who is alive) has an ascending aorta. What you are describing is often termed ‚Äúpost-stenotic dilation of the ascending aorta‚Äù. Your doctor was right in saying - it could be a result of the stenosis, or sometimes children have a little bit of a bigger measurement than normal, and as they age - they ‚Äúgrow into it‚Äù. Similar to other body parts, it‚Äôs just most people don‚Äôt know this. My lab has plenty of kids come through with subtle abnormalities that eventually even out. My lab uses the pediatric heart network (PHN) which is one of the most prevalent resources available. It‚Äôs uses a system of ‚ÄúZ-scores‚Äù in which 2 standard deviations is considered normal limits for a child - based on their BSA. As a result, you may have slightly abnormal values with a slightly abnormal bsa. Likewise, it‚Äôs based on an average of kids, and there‚Äôs certainly kids who aren‚Äôt average, but are normal. As for the leakage this is a pretty common finding, as they tend to not behave physiologically like tricuspid aortic valves do. Ultimately it sounds like your doctor is just doing his job and making sure nothing goes unnoticed - this is good. It‚Äôs much better to have an overly cautious doctor.",1596242200,t3_i1iv7t,/r/chd/comments/i1iv7t/stressing_over_my_sons_latest_cardiologist_appt/fzxrfw9/
g022crr,i1iv7t,"Stress and worry is normal. Don't feel like it's abnormal or wrong to worry. He is your son, and you will always worry for him. That said, his cardiologist knows best. And while the prospect of eventual surgery is scary, it will be okay.\n\nI was born with a BAV. We found out when I was an infant, and I had to have an emergency angioplasty. I had open heart surgery at eighteen for a biologic aortic valve replacement and an aneurysm repair, and I am now almost twenty-seven and going for a second aortic valve replacement next week. This time, I'll be going against my initial, hard-headed ways and going mechanical though. ;) \n\nIt is a tough and scary process at times for sure! This never changes, but medical technology is awesome. I've never been the most physically active or sporty person, but I've definitely made an excellent life for myself thus far, and I don't intend to stop next week either. \n\nMy suggestions: \n\n1. As others have said, trust his cardiologist. They study for years and years to get this down. While I've had a few general doctors who weren't so great, I've personally always had great and detail-oriented cardiologists. (I'm sure part of it is self-selecting.)\n\n2.

I also have much anxiety from this, it's a scary thing to have to go through. I agree with the other posters that a more compatible therapist may be beneficial to you, but I would add a suggestion to find a therapist that has experience with meditation and its benefits. The combined 1, 2, punch of medication, to stop the fight or flight response, and meditation, to fight thinking patterns, I believe is a much better approach than either by themselves. I assume you are in the US, and so have very little knowledge of meditation, outside of what Hollywood says it is. Do some research into what it's really all about if you're skeptical. Read what psychology experts say about meditation and how it can be used. The meditation subreddits tend to be skewed towards more spirituality so I'm not sure if they'd be much help to you or not.

fziqrob,hzcjyh,"So I am a psychologist and these are some of my thoughts. The people telling you to find a therapist that is a better fit are on point. Therapy isn‚Äôt a check box that once you‚Äôve done it, you‚Äôre done. For people with ongoing medical conditions, its really normal to start and stop therapy based on what is going on medically and the stressors in your life. It‚Äôs also not a failure to need a therapist - you are having to cope with above and beyond things and it makes sense to need help above and beyond what the next person may need.\n\nIf you can, I would find someone who has some experience with medical conditions and knowledge of medical trauma (given your age, maybe ask if there are any pediatric psychologists at your hospital - a pediatric psychologist is essentially a child psychologist who specializes in seeing kids with medical conditions). I would be willing to bet you‚Äôre not just having an anxiety response but that there could be some sort of medical trauma that you have.\n\nLastly, something to think about in the meantime. When you think about the next 3 years you are overwhelmed. It‚Äôs because our minds are not good at seeing all that‚Äôs to come and appreciating the actual time span. 3 years feels close but it‚Äôs also a lot of time. Today you are not having surgery. Tomorrow you are not having surgery. Even in one year, it sounds like you‚Äôre not having surgery. Try to stay in the moment of now. When you don‚Äôt, you live through tomorrow‚Äôs fears repeatedly before it‚Äôs even happening. When it is time for your procedure, you may need support in taking that a day at a time.

fxzntlr,hqqphr,"Well, first the good news, my childhood was about as normal as you could imagine it being. I won't say it was ""normal"" but I felt as normal as I humanly could. There were very few ""limitations"". I played sports (to an extent), I went to school, I played with freinds etc etc. I don't remember much of the time between my BT shunt and the second part of my Fontan (4 years old) but from what my parents tell me I was very blue (low oxygen) and lacked energy but was otherwise ok. After the Fontan childhood was pretty normal. I still went to the hospital way more than most children but mostly for checkups and routine stuff. My entire life I have had twice a year checks with a cardiologist that almost always include an echocardiogram and and EKG, but again that is mostly just keeping an eye on things. \n\nI did have a pacemaker put in at age nine because my heart struggles to regulate my heartbeat on its own. That did change a few things about how ""normal' my childhood felt. I lost the ability to play contact or high energy sports. But my overall energy definitely bwemt up. \n\nI have also had other minor health problems continue to pop up due to the shunt and Fontan but they are all way better than the alternative, obviously. I have had thyroid problems and my liver and lungs are under more internal pressure than most people because of all the ""rewiring"". I still only have ~86% oxegyn levels, but am otherwise alright. \n\nAs for day to day life overall, at this point in my life and for most of my life really, if I didn't tell someone about my HRHS they wouldn't know. I graduated HS, went to college, I now teach 7th grade history and coach basketball and track. I excersise regularly by walking and cycling. I have never been able to run well or lift weights because of the low heart rate, low oxygen levels, and the vein taken from my right arm to help in the shunt/fontan. But otherwise it would be hard to tell. \n\nI need to tell you there is hope. I know from talking to my parents and other parents going through this how scary and downright terrifying it can all be. Mostly just the ""not knowing"", but it gets better. Hospital visits are always going to be there. And I nor anyone else can guarantee everything will go well, but I promise there is real hope.

The BT and the Fontan were performed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

There is a real chance this never happens in my lifetime, and I am 100% ok with that.

Hypothyroidism, my lungs are forming little micro ""tubuals"" that are losing blood/oxygen, etc.  But all of that is quite alot better than the alternative.

I always planned on college and a normal career and life. I now have all those things. It wasn't until I went to college and my mom called me ALOT (haha) that I realized it wasn't like that for them. They were scared all the time. Every time I twisted a knee, fell off my bike, or worst of all came home from school sick they were terrified. However, they never once showed it. And in hospitals, everytime I would get hooked up to a new machine or IV my mom would leave the room claiming she didn't like the sight of blood. I now know that's not true. She couldn't handle seeing me like that and cleverly used that excuse. Then came right back in after she was composed.

fwi0qkr,him6h3,"Hey i‚Äôm not op but I could provide some insight. I‚Äôm 19 and was diagnosed with TGA and immediately got an ASO (never had aortic coarctation). 4 years later I needed a pulmonary artery reconstruction due to the narrowing of the vessel. Then at 8 years old I needed a new pulmonary valve due to its back flow . All 3 of those were open heart surgeries and then I received another valve through a catheterization. Around the surgeries i‚Äôve been 100% active all my life in all types of sports. Played soccer since 5 years old even at a higher level during my high school years. I‚Äôve also been active with weights the past couple years. Only real limitations for me would be not being allowed to play contact sports (football, mma, etc.) although i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôd be fine playing them as i‚Äôve been rough in soccer. I believe TGA patients can experience more complications in the future due to the large amount of change to the heart and formation of scar tissue. Despite that you can still be 100% healthy and capable of anything you put your mind to with the diagnosis.

fwftjez,hidpag,"Well, I‚Äôm not sure how helpful this will be, but hopefully you can you something from my experience. Our daughter was born at 39 weeks after planned sedation because we already knew about her heart defect. My daughters condition is a little different than your sons. She was expected to be pretty stable at birth and she was. We didn‚Äôt get any skin to skin contact and she was taken from us immediately to have an IV and other lines put in her umbilical cord. We got to see her for about one minute inside an incubator transfer cart and then she was moved to the PICU for echo. It sucked not being with her right after birth. But, a few hours later we could visit her in the PICU. She had tons of wires on her and we couldn‚Äôt hold her for a few days and that meant she couldn‚Äôt be breastfed. The PICU and postpartum were on different floors of the hospital as well. It was very painful to see my wife struggle to get her milk supply in using a breast pump while my daughter was probably hungry and on a completely different floor. I will never forget when one of the pediatric cardiologists said she thought she was ready to try to breastfeed. \nThey will measure everything in and out. I think this is pretty much standard. They will also have a lot of wires hooked up at all times. All of the wires and machines can be a little intimidating at first. If you plan on bringing pajamas or onesies to the hospital then make sure they are easy to zip open. I like the ones that zip at the bottom because I can feed all of the wires from the monitor through the foot opening. \nI would definitely research the hospital and see what information they can give you. We are in the states but I‚Äôm sure all hospitals are very different. A few things I would ask if you haven‚Äôt already:\n-Is there a separate PICU or will we be in the NICU? \n-Will we stay together or be in different rooms postpartum?\n-Will we stay in PICU/NICU or are we expected to go home after mother is discharged?\n-Any restrictions of breastfeeding right away?\n-Will a breast pump be supplied and if so what model?  Buy more parts beforehand. They are cheap on amazon and our hospital wouldn‚Äôt give extra and I would wash them every 2-3 hours. I also recommend oxo tot on the go drying rack with brush.",1593487377,t3_hidpag,/r/chd/comments/hidpag/experience_having_a_full_term_baby_in_nicu/fwftjez/
fwfxxq4,hidpag,"Another different heart defect here, but may have had similar experiences to what you will have. My son had TGA so they were certain he needed open heart surgery, and he had keyhole surgery at an hour old. I was still able to have ~30 seconds of skin to skin at birth, and we were able to hold him as soon as we visited him in the NICU the next day (we didn‚Äôt get to the ward after seeing him after his keyhole surgery until around 4am).\n\nA couple of things may be different, but your bub will still have a lot of similarities to other NICU babies. I imagine they‚Äôll still track everything in and out, or at least they did for ours, as they want to know that he/she is feeding well before and/or after surgery (if needed) and before they go home. They‚Äôll likely still encourage lots of skin to skin and breastfeeding, as they want them to have as many antibodies as possible to help potential fight infections in case of surgery. They‚Äôll want baby to be putting on good amounts of weight again before they allow you to take them home, as strong, weight gaining babies recover (generally) more quickly. In fact that was what was holding us up from going home.\n\nThey told us not to bother with bringing outfits as NICU babies are usually too small for them and need to be kept in the incubator, but we were told on day 2(?) to bring some because he was strong enough to be in an open isolette (can‚Äôt remember if that‚Äôs the right word?). Husband had to rush home to wash and dry the clothes we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd need for a few more weeks!\n\nAs the other poster said, ask if you‚Äôll be in the NICU or PICU at your hospital. We were in the NICU at first, then transferred to a specialist children‚Äôs hospital where he was on the cardiac ward (with kids of all ages), then PICU after his big surgery, then cardiac ward again.

I got to hold him for a second a couple of hours after birth, then they took him. After I got discharged I was able to see but not hold him. I don‚Äôt really know why. I did get to hold him briefly before open heart surgery, which was one week after birth. Then a few weeks after, once he was stable, I got to properly hold him. I‚Äôve been exclusively pumping from day one as his cardio team does not want him to nurse due to his heart.",1594120081,t3_hidpag,/r/chd/comments/hidpag/experience_having_a_full_term_baby_in_nicu/fx7092s/

I know they don‚Äôt let you hold preemies much due to overstimulation causing them to burn calories, didn‚Äôt think it would be so much a problem with heart babies, especially since touch has been proven to even out heart rate.

g3639u4,hidpag,"Hey thanks for the advice. My son was born July 21. Was a traumatic vaginal birth and he lost some oxygen so ended up with a brain injury. We spent two weeks in nicu. Despite being pretty adamant on breastfeeding when pregnant, there was so much going on with everything that I opted to formula feed instead of being tethered to a pump. I also don‚Äôt respond well to pumps. He also had pretty bad lip, tongue and cheek ties which we only got fixed once he was out of nicu. \nThe nicu was super amazing and I owe my sons life to them, but I‚Äôm glad to be home!\nI‚Äôm also a nurse so was pretty comfortable with the lines. There were a few days when I couldn‚Äôt hold him as he was being cooled for his brain injury, and then had to be on 24 hour video eeg monitoring.\nOh! And my son was 9 pounds as wel. We definitely got a few comments about him being the biggest baby there lol\nAll that and one bonus was he never needed heart surgery after all, at least.",1598644406,t1_g34yket,/r/chd/comments/hidpag/experience_having_a_full_term_baby_in_nicu/g3639u4/
fwii9kr,hidpag,"She has TOF/PA. She was tube fed for about 5-6 years. For about 4 years most of her nutrition was via tube. As to why, bythe time she was extubated, she had lost the initial swallow reflex they have, she also was burning a ton of calories. She also had a cleft palate which complicates things. \n\nKeep in mind every case is so different, even between kids with similar defects.

fvmu7aa,hdrkmr,I‚Äôm sure your provider is taking a lot of precautions to keep your child safe. Also - it‚Äôs worth noting PCP‚Äôs are not typically familiar with complex heart disease so what may be normal for your child might sound slightly abnormal to them. For example - the PA is usually anterior and leftward. Post arterial switch the MPA‚Äôs are draped over the aorta so the auscultation might be in a different location.,1592831631,t3_hdrkmr,/r/chd/comments/hdrkmr/anxious_for_the_next_visit_this_week/fvmu7aa/
fvmuc3x,hdrkmr,My TGA son will have a murmur for life. It‚Äôs to be expected,1592831717,t3_hdrkmr,/r/chd/comments/hdrkmr/anxious_for_the_next_visit_this_week/fvmuc3x/
fvohrsg,hdrkmr,"Came to say what the other TGA parent said. We also have a very healthy, active TGA toddler with a heart murmur. In his case, it‚Äôs slight leakage of the pulmonary artery valves (they‚Äôre slightly weaker because of the operation), which according to our cardiologist happens in 95% of TGA repair babies, and around 98% of those *won‚Äôt* ever need surgery to repair it, which even then would be many years down the track.\n\nOr maybe I got those numbers switched around, our last appointment was around 8 months ago. But the point was: very common, and very low chance of it meaning something bad and needing repair.\n\nStill, it‚Äôs good that you have a cardiologist appointment because a) sounds like you‚Äôre nearly due for one, b) they tend to weaken as they get older (I‚Äôm talking, well into adulthood) so it‚Äôs part of the reason TGA babies need yearly/biyearly monitoring, and c) we obviously aren‚Äôt cardiologists who know your baby‚Äôs specifics. But try not to stress in the meantime, seems pretty normal from what I gathered.",1592862386,t3_hdrkmr,/r/chd/comments/hdrkmr/anxious_for_the_next_visit_this_week/fvohrsg/

fvmutdu,hdrkmr,I hope youre right. Getting in with the heart doctor will clear our questions. Its just that Ive been sick to my guts since getting the news from the PCP so ive been constantly checking his sats every day (dunno if that means anything).

fvmvh9d,hdrkmr,"So it‚Äôs really common when they do an arterial switch to hear a flow related murmur. Peds cardiologists know this, but general pediatricians aren‚Äôt very familiar with it.
