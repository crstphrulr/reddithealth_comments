i6nh5x8,ueitih,"I have been using the FSL since 2020. You will need both the sensor and the clugose meter. The FSL is great in giving you an idea what can cause spikes (highs) and lows, but you will need the backup of a finger prick when the sensor tells you something different from how you feel.\n\nWhen having a hypo you need the blood glucose meter to see where you are right now, instead of an trend arrow that might give you the wrong information.\n\nThe FSL is great, but on it's own not sufficient to measure your blood glucose. Abbott advises the finger prick even.\n\nJust that you can use the finger prick as double check, in stead of being the main way of checking your blood glucose and damaging your fingertips.",1651230575,t3_ueitih,/r/diabetes/comments/ueitih/is_libre_worth_it/i6nh5x8/

i6ng3oh,uehvg2,"I have never had a satisfying answer to this question, neither from my endo nor from reading various opinions online about the subject. \n\nA few observations though:\n\n* Non diabetics aren't in the 80-120 range **most** of the time. They're in the 80s **most** of the time, and only are above that postprandial. \n\n* Most endos will not recommend to their diabetic patients to target the 80-120 range, especially to T1s, because doctors rather have you be high than be liable for their patient go into a hypo. My endo straight up told me to always target 120-140 and that's _good enough_ for me. When I pressed about the issue, they admitted that the're trained to always favor highs to lows because of the risk of hypos and that they're trained to watch for A1c numbers more than spikes on a day to day basis.\n\n* According to some studies I came across, for diabetics, even with a normal A1c, the postprandial spikes are more correlated with long term complications, especially when it comes to the eyes. \n\n* On a personal level, even with me keeping my A1c in the non diabetic range for over a year now, I can feel that the postprandial spikes (140-180) have an effect on my eyes and it's starting to show after a few visits to the ophtalmo. \n\n* Something else I have read on a few occasions, it's not about how high you go or for how long, it's the huge swinging of BG from lows to highs that is damaging to the body. Going from 90 to 180 and down again is what's causing more damage rather than how long you stay in the high. \n\nOf course, take all of the above with a grain of salt, as this is not settled science and you'll find studies pointing to different conclusions. I just wish there was more discussion on the topic instead of having conversations like these be downvoted.",1651229846,t3_uehvg2,/r/diabetes/comments/uehvg2/80120_glucose_is_considered_normal_but_does_that/i6ng3oh/
i6nkibu,uehvg2,"I am under the belief that it is different for everyone. Of course the answer is to keep it in a good range (80-120) and that's gonna be your best chances... BUT, I ran in the 200-350 range for nearly 20 years... And I am paying for it.  \n\n\nTHAT SAID THOUGH... My complications are numb feet/legs, digestion problems, early arthritis, sexual problems. BUT my eyes have miraculously not changed since I was in my 20's (i'm now 41). So it just hits everyone different and there is no quantified objective answer to this.  I've seen diabetics with terrible eye trouble that has had better control than I did. I have seen diabetics on dialysis and failed kidneys. I also know several diabetics that don't have any real serious complications that don't take great care of themselves.

i6nc268,uehvg2,I ALSO HAVE THIS QUESTION,1651226774,t3_uehvg2,/r/diabetes/comments/uehvg2/80120_glucose_is_considered_normal_but_does_that/i6nc268/
i6nftet,uehvg2,"I have a variation on this question. Since being diagnosed, I've had 3 endocrinologists (due to practice or insurance changes) plus my regular doctor talk to me about this, and I've also done a ton of reading online (like most of us). There seem to be 2 schools of thought:  \nOne says that anything over 160 starts to do damage, and that the more time you spend below this, the safer you are. And, obviously, the higher you go, the more damage you're doing. So you're better off staying at 140-150 all day (high protein and veggies and fats, as few carbs as possible) than have a meal where you spike to 250 but then 2 hours later drop down to 110 as the insulin and meds kick in.  \nThe other school says that even at 150 your doing minute damage and it adds up over time, because you're forcing your body to constantly be producing insulin as the body is slowly digesting that meal, and the more time you spend in the normal range, the better, even if you have a peak or two per day above 175-180. They are the ones who recommend more whole grains in the diet, despite it not being lo-carb anymore.\n\nFor me, because I don't know what to believe anymore, and because as I get older (I'm 61, Type 2 for about 10 years now, A1C was always below 6.0 on meformin but now I'm at 6.0 on 2000 mg per day), I'm discovering that I need to have a little bit of carbs with each meal in order to 'trigger' my insulin production (like, half a piece of bread with lean meat/fish and veggies) and avoid fatty foods like bacon and steak, and to eat smaller meals. My clue is that when I finish eating, I should still be a little hungry. It sucks, but it seems to be working, especially with dinner. My stomach is growling when I go to bed, but my morning numbers have dropped from 140 to 115 and my A1C went from 6.3 a year ago to 6.0 last week. \*I've only been doing this new diet for 5 months. No weight loss, just different portioning and choices.\*  \nThis is the big problem with diabetes - it affects us all differently. We each have to find what works for us to keep the A1C as low as possible. I figure that if they say normal is anything below 120, then anything above that is doing damage. Our job is to minimize the damage, which means sticking as close to 120 or lower as many hours a day as we can, and if we go higher, keep that as low and short as possible. 4 hours at 150 vs 1 hour at 200 is probably the same in how it affects the cells of the body.",1651229646,t3_uehvg2,/r/diabetes/comments/uehvg2/80120_glucose_is_considered_normal_but_does_that/i6nftet/
i6n9e6j,uehi3j,"Diabetes is chronic high blood sugars, so you have kind of the opposite happening. \n\nThere is a condition called reactive hypoglycaemia, i‚Äôm not too knowledgeable about it and not at all suggesting this is something you have, only testing can tell you that but might be worth you looking into, I believe there is a sub for it, my basic understanding is a person over produces insulin after carbs and it drops their blood sugar too low. There is some overlap with this condition and T2 diabetes but it isn‚Äôt the same thing. \n\nWith testing, avoid testing too soon after eating wait 1-2 hours, otherwise you might end up seeing numbers that seem too high when in reality, your body just didn‚Äôt have enough time to do its thing and bring them down. \n\nOtherwise just keep your metre with you and test when you don‚Äôt feel right, see if it correlates with low blood glucose, if it does, make notes to see if there is a pattern. Does it occur after certain foods? exercise? etc. so you have all the info you can get to discuss with a doctor if you need to.  \n\nHope you get to the bottom of it and feel better soon",1651224521,t3_uehi3j,/r/diabetes/comments/uehi3j/found_out_i_had_low_blood_sugar_after_i_had_to_go/i6n9e6j/

i6nd9pz,uehi3j,"Ok so you don't have diabetes as we have the opposite problem. \n\nSee your doctor for a general check up to see if there's anything going on with you medically.\n\nIf there isn't, some people just seem to suffer with this. In terms of managing it, it's not great to be relying on fast sugar like sugar cubes or Gatorade. Before working out, you ideally need something an hour or so before that's going to take your body a bit of time to get the sugar out of it. Something like oats, rice, bread etc. Think carbs rather than sugar. If you still have issues then try sipping something sugary while you work out.\n\nGet some glucose tablets and keep these on you to treat when you drop suddenly.

i6mlw08,udyqnc,"Yes, probably so. With basal, ideally you would be fasting and drop to the 80s and if it were just enough it would hover there and never dip below 75.\n\nIf you are in the habit of eating throughout each day, it is possible to take a little extra basal to compensate for some of the food, and then need a little less rapid; but again, ideally, you wouldn‚Äôt be going low, or spiking high for too long. Easier said than done. \n\nDepending on your brand of basal, you might have more even coverage if you split the basal insulin ‚Äî seems most people who use Levemir find this to be true: One daytime dose and one nighttime dose as the first one starts to wear off. But if you were using Tresiba brand of basal, then you probably would not need more than one shot per day, because it is longer lasting. As others say, ask your doctors about this if you think your insulin is too much after taking it and then not enough toward the end of the day. \n\nI am not good with scheduling doses, and have a random sleep-work schedule; so I bought a Timesulin pen cap to help me realize how much time has gone by between doses.

i6iv3jw,uds1qb,"My story might be relevant to your situation. I am a 65 year old male, this took place two years ago ...\n\nI was on a relatively mild dose of rosuvastatin (10 mg). When I started my A1C was 5.5, which Canadian guidelines classify as the threshold for ""at risk"" (for Type 2 Diabetes). I was not informed of the risk of diabetes by either my PCP or cardiologist. Three years later my A1C was 10.4. When I later discovered the association of statins with diabetes development I was absolutely floored, but neither doctor was at all phased. Following this I developed a lump in my (male) breast for which I underwent a mammogram to receive a diagnosis of gynaecomastia (the development of hormonal breast tissue in men, also associated with statins). At that point I outright refused to take statins, leading to my cardiologist refusing to treat me further. By that time I had done enough research to insist on a CGM, to ""eat to the meter"" and reduce carb intake significantly, to exercise regularly, and to get my weight down nearly 40 lbs. As a result I reduced my triglycerides significantly and I got my  A1C down to 5.1. I held my ground, found a new PCP and cardiologist, and I also found a nutritionist supportive of my diet (another story there).\n\nThe diabetes is now officially in remission, the breast lump has disappeared, but I have developed a cataract in one eye that will be operated on. Cataracts are also associated with statins. In a sense I am very lucky to have realized the damage my elevated blood sugars were doing, and I live a much healthier life now. My LDL cholesterol count is slightly higher than the reference level (3.58 mmol/L), so I insisted on an NMR particle count (very rare in Canada), which revealed my LDL is ""Pattern A"" (i.e. *not* a risk factor). I occasionally have to defend my decision to avoid statins, but this last test seems to convince people.\n\nI cannot say for sure that the statins led to my diabetes (T2DM).  I was not leading a healthy life, I was sedentary, and I was eating/drinking far too much sugar. I may still have developed gynocomastia and cataracts without the statins. But I will continue to avoid statins. The ""[NNT](https://www.thennt.com/nnt/statins-persons-low-risk-cardiovascular-disease/)"" (Number Needed to Treat) for any benefit is more than one hundred, and any benefit comes with a comparable risk of diabetes development.

i6m7q2x,uds1qb,"Statins, according one branch of research, may lower cholesterol in people but generally add no cardiovascular benefit to nearly90-somthing-% of people who take them. One large study that advocated for taking ststins, also showed this to be true. And the ‚Äúlife-saving‚Äù effect for those millions of people averages out to about 1 week longer life expectancy. \n\nNow, if you have had a cardiovascular event or at a significant risk for a negative event, then it is recommended to take them. But, allegedly, half or more of the people who end up in hospital with a cardio event have perfectly acceptable LDL levels, so at best statins seem like a risk reduction ‚Äî not a guarantee, because LDL levels don‚Äôt necessarily predict cardio events ‚Äî not like it is being sold as a public mantra. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090112130653.htm\n\nThe people who advocate for statins largely insist that ‚Äúside effects‚Äù are rare, and are a\ntransient effect or a mass figment of the imagination.

So asking us if you should take them or not isn‚Äôt going to give you great info to deal with, I think. Consult with other physicians, do your research ‚Äî adjust your meds as necessary and know that there is no agreement on this issue.

Now we know that they also help to protect your heart and whole cardiovascular system from damage. The link between cardiac issues and diabetes is incredibly strong so having looked at the data, for me it's worth it purely down to that. However, there's more research coming out that shows that statins seem to have some protective factors for the kidneys too. This is very early stage research but is really promising. Given that 50% of the dialysis population has some form of diabetes, this could be a huge breakthrough. \n\nThe media likes to kick up a fuss about statins. Some people do react badly to them but there are a ton of different statins. If you get any side effects at all, you swap to a different one. \n\nDo your research and look at actual medical research on this or just trust your doctor.

i6h5iji,udikuz,"In regards to no meat- I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for 20 years and have just been modifying recipes that would normally include meat to instead include tofu or tempeh. I control my diabetes with diet and exercise and the Mediterranean diet has been key for me. I do a salad before lunch and dinner every day, and then a portion of protein and a portion of carbs. Half the plate is greens, a quarter is carbs and a quarter is carbs. I got a book about the glycemic index and glycemic load which was very helpful and got several Mediterranean diet cookbooks for ideas. I think the glycemic index book was probably most helpful for me until I got a glucose meter and just started testing multiple times a day",1651107978,t3_udikuz,/r/diabetes/comments/udikuz/prediabetic_and_looking_for_help/i6h5iji/
i6hdrry,udikuz,Until you meet your dietician. I would try one of these cookbooks for recipes\n\n[Diabetes-Friendly Cookbook](https://11b91zw8awencp9ao8ed28j9hd.hop.clickbank.net)\n\n[Kustom Diabetes](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/384677/Aja210/),1651111747,t3_udikuz,/r/diabetes/comments/udikuz/prediabetic_and_looking_for_help/i6hdrry/
i6hrcrb,udikuz,"So there's this really nasty assumption among medical professionals that T2 diabetes is a ""lifestyle disease"" and therefore anyone who presents with T2DM must not have been taking care of themselves. Therefore anyone with prediabetes must learn to ""eat better"" regardless of their current, actual eating habits. Sometimes it is the case that a prediabetic patient can benefit from changes to their diet but that is not always the case and even when some benefit can be achieved it is not always enough to enter remission.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that someone who is diagnosed with prediabetes who eats cake every day and drinks sugary drinks at every meal might benefit a lot from dietary interventions but someone who is already not eating a lot of processed sugar likely will see limited results unless they go on a hardcore low carbohydrate diet, and even then. The problem is that when you have people who are already eating a reasonably healthy diet and you tell them that they need to ""fix"" their eating habits without actually knowing what those eating habits are you risk pushing people who are struggling to grapple with their new chronic illness into disordered eating.\n\nIt happens a lot.\n\nTaking a step back an A1C of 5.9 isn't bad at all. It's definitely elevated hence your diagnosis but it's not something that you need to lose sleep over or feel like you need to address in a hurry. It's not actually causing damage to your body it's just a sign that sometime probably sooner rather than later you'll develop full-blown T2DM that will cause damage to your body if you don't do something about it. So yeah, make some common sense changes to your diet if you haven't already like cutting out sugary drinks and limiting food made with processed sugars to special occasions but beyond that you're fine.\n\nIf those simple changes to your eating don't bring you blood sugars down to where you and your doctor feel comfortable then you can look into starting medication. Not everyone's prediabetes can be treated with diet and exercise alone. Not all chronic illnesses can be overcome through force of will.\n\nFinally, though this sub will definitely make it seem otherwise the idea that diabetics ought to eat an ultra low carbohydrate diet is very much a minority opinion among actual medical professionals. Everything in moderation.",1651118036,t3_udikuz,/r/diabetes/comments/udikuz/prediabetic_and_looking_for_help/i6hrcrb/

A 30 minute walk after a meal will do wonders for your blood glucose.\n\nDiet management is avoiding sugar (obvious), and carbohydrates like rice, bread, potatoes, cereal, pasta, corn‚Ä¶.your body converts all these to sugar. I find my blood glucose does well if I keep my carb intake under 100 grams of carbs a day.

I highly recommend it. \nMy diet has shifted in 3 years to mainly raw vegetables, salads, cooked vegetables, chicken, fish and some pork and beef. The ‚Äúzero sugar‚Äù soft drinks are good, much preferred over diet soda. Water is the best. I think the recommended amount is 1/2 ounce of water per pound of weight.

Do not eat ice cream or pies or sweet desserts with lots of calories. Pie or cake, just eat a small sliver. No more than 15 to 20 carbs. Why eat desert first? If you bolus lots of insulin, then eat a tremendous amount, you will slow down your digestion so that you could slip into low blood sugar.\n\nEat a salad second or along with the dessert. Fill up on veggies and fiber at the salad bar, so you will slow down your eating. Get full at the salad bar. Do they have soup? Usually that is not too high in carbs. \n\nNext comes the fun food plate. Take a plate and get only small portions and notice what you are eating. Eat lots of different foods and plan your last plate. Sample the variety of food at the deli. Do not really fill up this plate. Make a note of your favorite flavors. Sometimes I will take pictures of this plate. \n\nWait for a while and drink a zero calorie beverage, like coffee or tea or diet pop. Talk with your friends or your date.\n\nWhile everyone else is getting desert, go get a last dinner plate. For your last plate, go back and get small portions of the best tasting food that you sampled in the last plate. I usually go back and get some fish or soup or the roast, something that digests slowly.\n\nI think back and remember what I ate. I love thinking about food. I will take mental notes of the best food at each deli. Sometimes I drift off to sleep remembering delicious food at a deli dinner. A deli will often have the same foods every day, so you can visit again. \n\nTest your blood sugar 2 or 3 hours after you finish eating, and take a little insulin if you feel high. You should have some glucose tablets with you if you are running low.\n\nOnly visit the deli as a special treat, but plan your visit.",1651155711,t3_ud8xbu,/r/diabetes/comments/ud8xbu/t1d_and_all_you_can_eat_bufets/i6jc0la/

i6fffw0,ud7hyb,"i've traveled a bunch, both domestically and international. have never had any trouble. security knows what medical equipment looks like and frankly couldn't care less about it in your luggage. if you have a pump/cgm, it's recommended that those do not go through the x ray or the body scanners (metal detector is fine, though it will likely be set off by the pump). so i just disconnect my pump and hand it and whatever spare sensors i'm traveling with to the security agent to do an explosive check. they know to get it back as quick as possible and i've never had any issues.\n\nyou definitely do not need to carry a prescription with you. i've never had anyone ask for one.\n\ninsulin is stable at room temp for at least 30 days, so you don't need to worry about keeping it cool for the flight/journey to where you end up staying. just keep it in your carry on. whatever you do, DO NOT PUT ANY DIABETES SUPPLIES IN A CHECKED BAG. don't wanna risk losing it!\n\noh and bring double what you think you'll need. that's my rule of thumb.\n\nmost importantly: have an incredible trip!!! and let the leader of the trip know you're diabetic so they know how to help if you need any!",1651081723,t3_ud7hyb,/r/diabetes/comments/ud7hyb/international_travel_with_t1d/i6fffw0/

I used to travel internationally for work (France, Netherlands, China, Korea, ...) all the time, and still do some international travel (Mexico, Bahamas, Canada, ...) for leisure.  22 years T1D, MDI.\n\nActive bolus insulin is in my ""pancreas"" kit (a pencil bag that has my meter, pens, lancing device and pen needles).  I keep my basal and unused bolus insulin in a soft sided insulated lunch bag with a reusable ice pack for travel on the plane.  The ice pack must be solid when you get to security, they will usually hand check the bag, and let you through.  Add 5 minutes to security estimate for this.  A reusable ice pack will have a name stamped on it like Nordic Ice or some other name.  They don't freeze insulin, but I put a thin towel between the ice and insulin for padding.\n\nTSA-Pre helps reduce the stress by not being required to remove all liquids (insulin) and have them in a quart baggie separated from carry on luggage.  With TSA-Pre just leave all liquids in the bags you have them in and let them do their manual search of the lunch bag if needed.\n\nIf you wear a CGM and/or pump, ask for a pat down instead of going through the back scatter device or metal detector.  These medical device manuals state they should not go through these devices.  Add 15 minutes to security estimate for this.\n\nAll insulin must be in your carry on as the hold will get too cold.  I keep 2 days of needles with me in case my luggage gets misplaced (never seen that happen in 28 years of air travel) and the rest go into my checked luggage.\n\nBring 1.5x-2.0x the supplies you think you need.  This will cover limited breakage and illness.\n\nFrio bags are better for hiking where the bag can be damp and dangle in the breeze for the ""cooling"" effect.  They will keep the insulin a little cooler than the air temperature but definitely not cold.\n\nUse in-room refrigerator or kitchen refrigerator when you arrive.  Just check the temperature setting to be sure it is somewhere in the middle of the range not at maximum cold.  You don't want the insulin to freeze. \n\nMost hotels can freeze the reusable ice packs for you in a real freezer for the trip home.\n\nPaper prescriptions can help if you run out of supplies while abroad and you need to get more.  Though being a foreign prescription, you may have issues getting it filled.  Cost will be whatever the full out of pocket cost for the country is.\n\nDon't forget to bring sugar.  I bring rolls of glucose tablets and keep 2 on me while traveling, and a roll when ever I go out to do something.

I did a month in Europe and I didn't keep my insulin in Frio bags or anything--it's good for ~3 months out of the fridge iirc so I just knew that the pens I took with me would be used on that trip or I would have to make a mental note of when they were removed from the fridge when I returned home, and use them before getting into new pens from my fridge.  I can't 100% remember but I *think* I did put my unopened insulin pens in fridges when I was staying in places with easy access.  \n\nAs far as taking your prescriptions with you, I've never done that but I did get a note from my doctor saying I am diagnosed with T1D and need to have my supplies with me at all times so that security didn't trip about the needles or anything...tbh in all my my trips I've taken I don't think I've ever had to actually pull the note out.  Most people tend to be understanding if you tell them you're T1D.  Even TSA has let me through with a few small bottles of apple juice.\n\nAs others have said, definitely bring double the supplies you think you'll need.

I've never needed more than that. \n\nRegarding keeping my insulin cool, I don't do it. Many hotels in Europe don't have in room refrigerators, but you can always ask the front desk to keep it in theirs. Most of the time I don't bother. \n\nKeep some sugar/snacks with you. You never know when you might get low and not have easy access or it's the middle of the night and your hotel doesn't have a vending machine. I packed a bunch of granola bars on a 3 week trip to Bangkok, Shanghai and Guangzhou. That was perfect for me. \n\nLastly, if you're a pump user I might suggest when inserting a new infusion set to leave the old one in!!! I've been plagued with occluded cannulas and nothing sucks more than having to switch to injected insulin because your site isnt working and you left your other infusion sets in the hotel.

i6f6ni2,ud2fw2,"Okay, so first off insulin injections aren't intramuscular so they don't actually go into your muscles. They're subcutaneous so the insulin is injected into the fat just underneath your skin.\n\nHaving said that, insulin causes changes to the fatty tissue it is injected into and those changes can build up over time if injection sites are not rotated or if some injection sites are used too frequently. This will eventually cause noticeable changes to the skin over the injection site which often appears as cratering or unusual firmness. When you notice changes to an injection site you cannot continue to use that site because the changes to the subcutaneous fat in that location will cause the insulin to not be absorbed at the rate that it should be. So you need to move to a different location even if it is just an inch or so in one direction.\n\nJust make sure that you rotate sites and give individual spots a rest.\n\nYou can technically inject into any fatty deposit on your body except your breasts, which should be avoided. Also avoid the area within an inch of your naval. Common injection sites include anywhere on your belly (avoiding the naval), the outer half of the front of your thighs, the outer and upper quadrant of your buttocks, and the fat of the back of your arms.",1651078273,t3_ud2fw2,/r/diabetes/comments/ud2fw2/injection_site/i6f6ni2/

Whereas neither tasted the same as OG Dr Pepper.\n\nNot everyone has the same sense of taste nor smell.\n\n>truly are indistinguishable\n\nThis cannot in fact, be true, if for no other reason than the texture / mouthfeel component. Even if you truly believe the ""zero sugar"" flavor profile is identical including the artificial sweeteners having zero aftertaste components whatsoever, texture and mouthfeel are a huge component of taste, and will alter the overall experience. They may not be distinguishable by nose or tongue taste, but mouthfeel between diet/zero and sugar will always remain unless they invest technology in creating an invert sugar alcohol (eg inverted allulose or something) that can match the texture of a sugar syrup based soda, or some other form of sugar free sweetener that can match the texture of corn syrup used in the US soda.\n\nIf you really still feel like mouthfeel doesn't have a huge impact on the perception of taste, I suggest giving this book a read:\n\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/Mouthfeel-Texture-Traditions-Perspectives-Culinary-ebook/dp/B01N0YWR65/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9K051TDH0I22&keywords=mouthfeel&qid=1651077413&sprefix=mouthfeel%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-1",1651077106,t1_i6f1wx2,/r/diabetes/comments/ucxup5/hope_this_is_as_good_as_the_cream_soda_ones/i6f3mqp/

So much vomiting and couldn't walk anymore, all I could do at the end was keep drinking electrolytes which helped me you know not die until I got proper care.. Got sick very fast and DKA. \n\nThen they did autoantibody tests which were extremely elevated and spent a long time in physio regaining muscles and relearning how to walk. So yeah if you're in doubt about diagnosis seek help sooner rather than later. i was just ignored due to my age. But it was only a couple months of being high day and night so it was quite quick.

These combined is an outdated methodology of controlling diabetes.\n\nAsking a T1 to eat that many carbs can be a way to encourage them to gain some of the weight back they lost before diagnosis.  Not sure why the requirement is there.\n\nEating low carb can have benefits, as it means lower amounts of insulin and the mistakes are smaller.  It can also help keep weight more steady and not gaining all the time.\n\nI don't eat low carb personally.  But that is because I don't want to eat differently than pre-diabetes.

Demand insulin for those occasions you eat carbs to excess. Don‚Äôt compromise. The medical community see‚Äôs you as an income for themselves.

It's a very strange experience to say the least.    Most importantly, I  lived normally until that point.  So learning to live with the dietary restrictions took some real effort.

They kept having these company events with catered food where I was required to attend, and it was always during my lunch break.

I was told my behavior was unacceptable and I wasn't being a team player.   At the same time, I discovered that the health insurance for my job did not pay for any medical devices (which included insulin pumps and test strips).    \n\nAdditionally, I was put on a rotation of doing overnight deployments nearly every weekend.   So in addition to not being able to control my food intake during the day at work, I had to go 2 nights in a row  (or more) without sleep.

Diabetes runs in the family, so I was at least moderately aware of what I was doing to my body with all that sugar, but the thought of diet pop was disgusting and I would literally spit it out if I was accidentally served a diet at a restaurant.  When my pancreas eventually succumbed to the abuse and I was diagnosed t2 in 2010 (with an a1c of nearly 11 ... gee I wonder what could have possibly driven it that high), it was either give up pop or go blind.  I'm ashamed to say the decision wasn't as much of a no brainer as it should have been.\n\nEventually I came to terms with my reality and quit my sugary drink habit.  And like most, I suffered through the transition to diet, hating what I was drinking but not being able to live without my fizzy bubbles and caffeine.  It took several months, but with all of the other changes to my diet, my taste buds did eventually die ... errr, I mean adjust ... and the diet pop stopped tasting horrid and drinking it became enjoyable again.\n\nAs others have said, some of the newer ""zero"" formulas are much closer to the taste of a normal soda and are worth trying.  Though let's be honest, no sane person is going to 'not know the difference'.\n\nHowever, a word of caution because I haven't seen it mentioned here yet.  The artificial sweeteners in pretty much all of the sugar free drinks have been linked to some pretty nasty health consequences.  If you can find alternatives that you can live with, you should.  I still drink my five or six bottles of various diet/zero pop a day, and at my volume it does add up and I can say that it is a likely culprit for some of my health complications.  Be mindful of that as you start thinking about your transition away from the nectar of the gods ... err, I mean sugary soda.\n\nOh, and while it's not cola, anyone who loves fizz and needs the caffeine fix that hasn't tried Blackberry ICE with caffeine is missing out.  I've tried all of the fizzy fruity drinks you can think of, and that stuff is by far the best.  I'm convinced it's made with a proprietary blend of unicorn dust, magic bean extract, and water from the fountain of youth.  The Amazon delivery drivers in my area hate me for a myriad of reasons, but they have a particularly nasty look on their faces when they have to schlep the 4 cases I have on subscription up my driveway to the porch every couple of weeks.  I almost feel bad for them.  Almost.\n\nGood luck on your journey!",1651037643,t3_ucrazn,/r/diabetes/comments/ucrazn/cola_i_love_you/i6d7y5a/

In essence, plan everything, and have a backup plan im case of emergency.\n\nEdit: 24 hours is double the duration of the flight I took.

However, it is important to remember that even though they didn‚Äôt have diabetes themselves, they did have to treat it 24/7 while I was too young to do so (diagnosed at 2). For that, they will be the closest persons to really understand what I went through, because they were there too. Being mindful that it probably wasn‚Äôt fun for them either, I try to approach it with a sense of empathy. \n\nOf course, there are the extremes of people that don‚Äôt get it. That is where I stick to facts. Try and leave the personal comments and emotional response out of it. It works for the most part, but online it is tricky. Remember that they are learning from you, and that can be a really frustrating journey. If they kick you out because of emotional reasons, it probably wasn‚Äôt a healthy platform to be on.

Avocados are delicious when made into Guacamole,  or when added to lots of different foods.\n\nLots of people in the USA immigrated from Mexico and brought recipes with them.  Lots of Produce sold in the USA is imported from Mexico (honestly, from all over Latin America),  so we have access to stuff that may not otherwise grow locally.  That said, much like India and most other places in the world,  every town, village, city, region, and even family has their own recipes and traditions.

The say you should eat fish twice a week maximum due to Mercury levels present in them. In Islam, we are not allowed to eat fish which does not have scales since scales in fish is used as a filtration system to clean and those fishes also don't eat dirty things.\n\nI lost around 40lbs maybe 2 years ago and that was when I cut down my carbs and started cycling, it melted all away in a matter of 3 months, most people were shocked when they saw me having lost this much weight. I think cutting down carbs plus movement is a solid protocol to loosing weight.\n\nI tried making Guacamole but don't think I am getting it right! I'll explore some of those foods you have mentioned, I am always intruuged how other cultures eat because to me food is medicine and sometimes when I find dishes from other countries that make me feel good and healthy then I tend to implement them right away, kind of trying to make a ""home menu"" at the moment which makes choosing what to eat healthy much simpler.",1651149059,t1_i6hsb1a,/r/diabetes/comments/ucblfj/anyone_tried_eating_burghul/i6ixn2m/

i66f9c3,ubujax,"I‚Äôm a recent diagnosis (t1) and I would never eat breakfast. After losing 40 pounds I‚Äôve been eating high fat low carb foods and I‚Äôve put back on about 25-30 of that weigh. Unfortunately it‚Äôs only about half  muscle - which I lost from intense DKA. \n\nNow I eat breakfast every day - two egg cheesy omelets with filler like black beans or pepitas. Sometimes I‚Äôll have two waffles with banana and peanut butter and cinnamon (lol) if I‚Äôm running a little bit on the lower side. I‚Äôm looking to cut back on the fats to start my day but man I‚Äôve really grown accustomed to how I eat so I do understand how a habit as such can be hard to break. If you want to maintain weight probably don‚Äôt start your day as I do. For me finding a tasty and healthier breakfast medium was difficult, but if you have insurance you are just a phone call away from a nutrition consultant. That‚Äôs a conversation that could give you much insight and inspiration. \n\nMy 2 cents for a palatable and Keto breakfast would be smoothies based in coconut milk and monk fruit extract for a sweetener. Be mindful of what decide to put in as fruits vary in the carb content and GI. \n\nUltimately, I think it is imperative that you cook for yourself as much as you can, so you can monitor EXACTLY what goes into your food and how your body reacts to it. \n\nThen there‚Äôs caffeine which is a double edged sword in this case. It is a stimulant which also inhibits your appetite somewhat, but diabetics can also be subject to spikes in bsg due to the intake. Before I had diabetes I would always match my coffee intake with 2x water shortly before and or after which could help manage any spikes if you are sensitive to it.",1650919170,t3_ubujax,/r/diabetes/comments/ubujax/foods_to_avoid_for_diabetic_weight_gain_or_high/i66f9c3/

I will share here a message I sent to Abbott after I noticed several sensors kept screwing up.. the last one was off by 60 points...\n\n------------------ MESSAGE-----------------\nMom and I are both in California,  USA.  I myself use another system.   The Dexcom G6 and that communicates via Bluetooth giving me consistency in data collection.  Initially I had my mother swap over to dexcom G6 as well. However one very unfortunate flaw was that she's on an iOS phone and I'm on Android, so while Dexcom worked great for me it had very poor connectivity issues with my mother's iOS device causing it to frequently disconnect and it got very annoying,  the data it did upload when I finally did connect was great,  as it would store hours of data on the transponder and upload hours of data when it finally did connect. \n\n  However the inconvenience of the device frequently losing connection was such a problem that my mother was annoyed enough too want to go back to freestyle libre which is awful because she'd very rarely scan herself,  she would only do it 1 time per day if anything at all.  I contacted Dexcom regarding this connectivity issue and was told that this was a common problem on some iOS devices due to Apple frequently patching out ""security issues"" which would often result in Dexcom device getting removed from trusted devices. \n\nNow,  I don't live close to her so monitoring this was very important to me,    when I brought up the issue with her to her endocrinologist,  we were told about the Libre2 which worked similarly to Dexcom with Bluetooth,  so she managed to get a trial version of the libre 2 to try out... however the problem now with the 2 was that the readings were often off by 25-50 points which is absolutely crazy innacurate so I'd be asking her to recheck by pricking her finger to see if we could calibrate it the same way we would with a Dexcom occasionally (Dexcom was pretty accurate btw) well Mom was very annoyed by the inaccuracy because of me asking her to always try to pick herself to calibrate so after the trial of the libre2 ended, my mother's insurance denied covering for the libre 2 and my mom was ok with that because she doesn't like pricking her fingers that often anyway,  so she went back to being now annoyed with the Dexcom again lol.    So despite the connectivity issues with Dexcom at least I'd have a consistent window of data and information captured to make sure she was maybe in range of taking care of her diabetes. \n\n\nWithout telling me recently she got the insurance to cover the libre freestyle 14... and she mistakenly thinks she doesn't need to scan it and often I see giant chunks of information missing so that's why I'm asking if the data is lost after a particular window of time.   I would really like her on the libre 2 if it wasn't so inconsistent in the accuracy... to be perfectly frank (honest) I see tradeoffs for everything but the libre 14 is the worst of the 3 since she rarely scans it...\n\nDexcom: accurate but connectivity issues with some iOS devices, however data isn't lost because when it does connect it loads hours of valuable data which is nice. \n\nLibre2: readings often off by 25-50 points requiring fingersticks  to try and recalibrate,  but I don't know if the device really recalibrate after this anyway as we didn't get to use it long enough but at least trends and data are captured.  But again I don't know how often it needs to be scanned to maintain this as we didn't get to try it for that long.  NOTE HINDSIGHT YOU CANNOT CALIBRATE LIBRE SENSORS , customer service told me they are factory set and if it's off then you must remove and replace for a new one. \n\nLibre 14 day: seems to only record when you scan.. but my mom only scans 1 time on average or up to 4 times if I constantly bug her to do it but when she does i notice giant chunks of data missing\n\n----------------------------\n\nTheir response was:\n\nWe appreciate the info and experience you provided in her use of  the products. Our apologies for the delay. Both FreeStyle Libre 2 and FreeStyle Libre 14 day systems would need to be scanned at least once every 8 hours otherwise it would cause gaps to appear on the graph. The sensor takes glucose measurement every minute but only gets recorded every 15 minutes or when an actual scan is made. The Sensors are factory calibrated and no longer needs actual calibration from the user as long as the sensor applicator used in applying the sensor is the same one that came in the box as the sensor because they are both coded to each other. - Sam P.\n\n---------------------\n\nI'm still on Dexcom...I wish my mom could also be on it too since she hardly scans.   I lose an unbelievable amount of data because of thisüòë",1650937552,t3_ubt7a6,/r/diabetes/comments/ubt7a6/freestyle_libre_2_came_defective/i67md3f/

There are still many countries that require most medications to be purchased and brought to the hospital for administration by hospital staff.

He said that his program was the first step toward that end.  It seems that his prediction was wrong. \nProof: \n >U.S. health expenditure as percent of GDP 1960-2020\nPublished by Jenny Yang, Jan 4, 2022\nIn 2020, U.S. national health expenditure as a share of its gross domestic product (GDP) reached an all time high of 19.7%. The United States has the highest health spending based on GDP share among developed countries. Both public and private health spending in the U.S. is much higher than other developed countries.\n\n>Why the U.S. pays so much more\n\n>While private health spending in Canada stays at around three percent and in Germany under two percent of the gross domestic product, it is nearly nine percent in the United States. Another reason for high costs can be found in physicians‚Äô salaries, which are much higher in the U.S. than in other wealthy countries. A general practitioner in the U.S. earns nearly twice as much as the average physician in other high-income countries. Additionally, medicine spending per capita is also significantly higher in the United States. Finally, inflated health care administration costs are another of the predominant factors which make health care spending in the U.S. out of proportion. It is important to state that Americans do not pay more because they have a higher health care utilization, but mainly because of higher prices.\n\n>Expected developments\n\n>By 2028, it is expected that health care spending in the U.S. will reach nearly one fifth of the nation‚Äôs gross domestic product. Or in dollar-terms, health care expenditures will accumulate to about 6.2 trillion U.S. dollars in total.   \n\nSource:  https://www.statista.com/statistics/184968/us-health-expenditure-as-percent-of-gdp-since-1960/  \n\nNow if you can get everyone in the country to take half of their normal salaries, the doctors might get on board of single payer.",1650918033,t1_i654boc,/r/diabetes/comments/ublmte/this_has_to_change_people_are_dying_because_of/i66ce2f/

I‚Äôve lost 80lbs over the past year and a half, and I‚Äôm working incredibly hard to appreciate the success that is, because I absolutely do not have the body confidence that should go along with it, I feel more insecure about my body now than I did at my heaviest, which sounds insane, but it‚Äôs the truth.

Due to various things, it took me a really long time to be okay with my physical appearance. I didn't *love* myself/my body before diagnosis but I came to the point where I was at least fine with it and accepted it as mine which was really hard to do and took years of working on myself. And yes, throughout the years I gained some weight, though there's not a connection between that and my body image stuff. But now every time I look in the mirror I just see the diabetes and every horrible thing I have ever heard said about a diabetic. Instead of seeing myself I see the disease, the hatred, and the complications I have seen other family members have (which were all of them extremes). I don't see a ""healthy"" person, I see the extreme opposite because of the diagnosis and the weight loss is an unavoidable reminder of that.

Factors\nto consider include directional trends in glucose and insulin concentrations, patient\nsafety, and individual patient preferences based on experience.

If blood ketones are modestly elevated (up to 1¬∑4 mmol/L), exercise should\nbe restricted to a light intensity for only a brief duration (<30 min) and a small\ncorrective insulin dose might be needed before starting exercise.

The sensor would last 2+ weeks with total accuracy if you could manage to keep the tape sticking that long, also very bad for business. The new adhesive is the only perk to the g6 I've found. So they ""fixed"" and ""upgraded"" the new ones with auto shut offs and whatnot making it better for business. In doing this they've ruined all it used to be.

There is also a sweet spot on the inside of the arm between the tricep and bicep if you can hit it, but I only used that spot with the G5 since I could easily tell where it would insert.

i6jd3qy,uaua9k,"I'm 30, diagnosed T1 at 3. I also had no parental supervision so i never developed any good habits, i never stood a chance. Now i need a multiple organ transplant and am on dialysis 3 times a week. My A1,c has been under 7 all my adult life, i finally figured out how to take control but it was too late. Didn't help I've always been very poor and got my medicaid shut off at 18. We all know how stupid expensive insulin is. \n\nim not trying to be political at all, that's not what this forum is about but I am going to mention some personal beliefs only because I tried to write this in euphemism and it was getting redundant and extra long winded so, apologies\n.\n I've thrown myself wholeheartedly into this world stuff  because most days (especially dialysis days) it's hard getting out of bed but I can go online and run my mouth and get fired up and feel like I'm helping. Like I'm not one of those 80year olds i sit next to every other day yelling at the nurses ""why won't you let me just die?!""(yes, i hear that literally weekly, from different people) \n\nmy doctor told me to get my double transplant id have to take the vax. I told him to go eff himself. This particular quack has almost literally killed me on more than one occasion. There are literally no other nephrologists or dialysis centers in over 40 miles from me so i can't sue him until I get a kidney or I'm screwed, conflict of interest, i couldnt stay at his facility.\n\nThis was over a year ago. I'm getting worse. I'm also married. To the best god-send of a man a fucked up person like me could ever hope for. I also smoke. It kept me from my first transplant screening but at the next place I tried they said they take smokers so i stopped trying to quit (extra hard when you're not allowed to eat anything or drink anything and you can't do anything or go anywhere and people in your house are smoking next to you) then they changed their minds....unless I get the vax first. I don't see what one thing has to do with another.\n\n My husband says he knows how important my morals are to me. Saying ""no"" to that first doc the first time is the only thing I've done i feel proud of in over 4 years. It's my only thing left. Dying slowly and painfully is scary but I made peace with that long ago. \n\nnow I'm watching my husband break slowly too. I can't quit smoking. I've tried many times. It's a personal problem, it's rediculous, it's idiotic. Just like my morals are my only internal lifeline cigarettes are my external coping mechanism. I'm so stuck and the clock is ticking. I've considered just disappearing and offing myself. I was a bit of a traveler in my youth so my family would buy that. At least convince themselves it's true.\n\n I finally convinced my husband to seek professional help to deal with this stuff so if i was going to take off now would be the time. I've tried to find help. Myself but literally the last 4 psychs i talked to said my problems were more than they could handle and basically good luck. No referrals or anything just...too bad. I'm also half blind (literally blind for a few months, macular degeneration is a bitch) but miracle of miracles my eyes half healed! I'm also an orphan with much history of trauma and abuse. \n\nThey say God doesn't give you more than you can handle.

i5z98gf,uanwbn,"You want to start with eyes?\n\nWell, let‚Äôs start with the test results. Normally you have about 1 teaspoon of glucose in all of your blood. So, glucose primarily comes from food, and more specifically from sugars and starches. Some protein coverts to glucose over a few hours, too. If you have a metabolic problem, then you are not able to move the glucose out of your bloodstream. \n\nNormal glucose is between 75 and 99 mg/dL when fasted or generally between meals for a few hours. After you eat, the food breaks down to glucose in your mouth a little but mostly in the upper part of the small intestine. After 2 hours (post-prandial) your glucose is expected to be below 140 mg/dL; some people will be back below 100, though ‚Äî lucky them. \n\nA1C is a different kind of blood test that looks at the amount of glucose that is stuck to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Over time, your hemoglobin molecules will randomly have glucose bumping into them, and glucose can get stuck to them permanently. The higher your glucose is each day, the more likely this random attachment will happen. Red blood cells are created and remain active for about 3-4 months, and so, the A1C represents about 3 months average. The number is usually in a range ‚Äî in the US, we use a percentage. Normal A1C is between low 4%s and mid 5%s ‚Äî once you get above 5.6%, that is considered a problem. They may call it ‚Äúprediabetic‚Äù if your A1C is between 5.6 and 6.5%. And above 6.5% is considered fully diabetic. A1C tests are not perfect but they are among the best tests we have to evaluate.\n\nSo, get your test results and see what the numbers are. If outside of the US, look for a ‚Äúglucose conversion chart‚Äù to see what your measurements mean.\n\nEyes can have problems from high glucose for a couple of major reasons ‚Äî damaged blood vessels, and pressure from the excess glucose. Most of your body‚Äôs cells need to use the hormone insulin to open up their cell wall with glucose transporters. But cells in the eye are not all the same. In the lens, glucose can just keep going in without the help of insulin. And so, inside the lens of the eye, an enzyme converts the glucose to other molecules that attract fluid. The lens of the eye can swell and vision can become blurred because light is no longer focusing at the back of the eye. \n\nOver time, this can damage the eyes and cause earlier cataracts but you are newly diagnosed. So, once you start treatment and management, your glucose will go down. But your eyes won‚Äôt go back to normal immediately. It takes several weeks for the fluid-attracting molecules to lessen. So, for a couple of weeks of more normal glucose, a lot of people realize their eyes are flipping out, becoming more far sighted ‚Äî they may not need their distance glasses for a week. But it is temporary; and eyes settle down and go back to whatever they should be. At 40+ you probably do have eye issues ‚Äî presbyopia. I also experienced new onset of astigmatism, so my eyes went from perfect at 39 to can‚Äôt get anything done without glasses at 45. \n\nPossibly the worst problems of eye damage from glucose is retinopathy. Blood vessels in the back of the eye become dysfunctional, so new ones are made to prevent the cells of the back of the eye from dying. But the new blood vessels are weak, and they leak blood into the vitreous fluid in the eye. People start seeing black spots ‚Äî worse than normal ‚Äúfloaters.‚Äù without intervention, people can suffer permanent damage and loss to their vision.\n\nBut you are new here, so you are going to learn all you can, and you are going to make a lot of effort each day to be as normal for as long as possible. And so, you can fix your immediate, temporary issues, and then delay or halt any long-term complications.\n\nAn ophthalmologist needs to be told you have diabetes, so beyond the normal check, they will need to shine a bright light to look at the back of your eye carefully. They may take images that they can show you. An ophthalmologist isn‚Äôt typically the same person who will give you a prescription for glasses, though, so you may also need to see an optometrist ‚Äî to do a series of vision tests to fit you for a prescription. But again, tell that person that you have diabetes and to check you for diabetic problems.\n\nBack to your diagnosis ‚Äî know that there are more than a couple of reasons for diabetes to happen. And you should feel free to ask why the doctor thinks you might be one Type versus another. Some of us do get the wrong diagnosis, and sometimes that is because doctor‚Äôs don‚Äôt think adults can develop autoimmune Type 1 diabetes. You‚Äôd only really know if you had antibody tests. An evaluation for insulin resistance would probably be HOMA-IR, but depending on your doctor they may or may not be curious to discover your cause.",1650789079,t3_uanwbn,/r/diabetes/comments/uanwbn/hi_just_diagnosed_friday_afternoon/i5z98gf/

Depending on your insurance, you may want to wait a bit before pulling the trigger on a nice new pair of glasses. My insurance covers 1 pair a year, and doesn't cover the full cost of the frames.

Keep in mind that there is some debate about these things, as some sets of studies seem to contradict each other. The thing is, keto hasn‚Äôt been studied as a health/weight loss technique for very long medically speaking.\n\n1. Keto might damage your kidneys long term. There‚Äôs a good set of studies that show a connection between Keto and kidney stones, and a smaller subset of studies that links Keto to more severe kidney damage. Diabetics are already at a risk factor for damage to organs just from the Diabetes. \n\n2. Keto can crash your blood sugar. Most doctors do not recommend Keto for type 1 for exactly this reason. It‚Äôs a little more flexible for type 2, but even then depending on what other treatments you‚Äôre on this can be a risk factor.\n\n3. Keto might contribute to heart disease. This one‚Äôs the most contested, because some studies seem to show it helps with heart disease, but it also may have to do with HOW you do Keto. Trans fats are pretty much agreed on across the board as bad news, but some folks on Keto don‚Äôt pay attention to what kind of fats they‚Äôre eating.  There are some studies that suggest that Keto in general is bad for this. Again, hard to tell because we haven‚Äôt had a particularly long time to study it. Still, with diabetics already at higher risk for heart issues, it‚Äôs good to keep in mind.\n\n4. There‚Äôs some evidence you can actually loose muscle mass on keto. It‚Äôs based on how your body builds muscle, and how carbs and protein work together to do it. \n\nThere‚Äôs also the fact that all bodies are different. Some folks may have metabolisms and genetic factors that make their bodies work with Keto better than others. \n\nMedline plus databases had a lot of really good info on the subject if your local library has access.\n\nAlso, this was specifically keto research, not low carb.

i60wyph,uajjha,"Awww, I don't hold all people responsible for some people, and that's so cool that you're studying this!\n\nI'll be very happy when dieticians recommend no more than 40g of carbs per *day* to type 2 diabetics, and preferably no more than 20g. There is so much politics around food, diet, medicine and diabetes of all types right now, that I'm not sure we'll see that happen in my lifetime.\n\nCarbohydrate (glucose) is the only food we can synthesize ourselves, via gluconeogenesis, as we can't synthesize either protein or fat, so carbohydrate is the only food we don't *need* as humans. Yet all I've ever heard from the entire medical profession is ""You *need* carbs for energy"". And the medical truth is, no you don't. Not if you have any fat reserves, and America has more obesity than any country on Earth, mostly because of this kind of thinking.\n\nEven on r/diabetes_t2, there are long-term ""professional type 2 diabetics"" who are still eating carbs and shooting insulin 30 years in and chasing their meter, when remission is possible within a year for *all* type 2's if they eat a low carbohydrate diet.\n\nHey, I've gotten off topic and started preaching.. something I do a lot of according to my wife. And since you're studying to be a dietician right now, let's put the focus back on that. Here's something that might interest you... it's the very first low carb diet publication in the world that I'm aware of. It's called ""[Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57545/57545-h/57545-h.htm)"", by William Banting, published in 1865. It's older English, and uses a wide vocabulary of the time, but is very readable. Banting was an undertaker who was getting fat and frustrated, and he noticed his doctor was treating type 1's and prolonging their lives with low carb diets (before insulin, so prognosis wasn't good, and this was just a life-extending treatment) so he tried it himself, lost a lot of weight and got healthier, and decided to write about it. Banting's letter made such an impact on the public that his name became synonymous with dieting. People would say ""I'm banting this month to lose some weight"". This word still exists in this context in some (older) dictionaries today.\n\nAtkins repopularized Banting's diet in the 1970s, and the new keto/carnivore/low carb/zero carb movement traces its lineage through Atkins back to Banting.\n\nInteresting side note.... I just re-read Banting's Letter and I think the man had Type 2 Diabetes and was able to put it in remission with his low carb diet! He wrote of ""finding my sight failing"" prior to beginning the low carb diet, and after going on the diet, he says ""My sight is restored"". That's pretty much textbook T2D and T2D remission. Cool!\n\nAnother interesting side note: In the old days before modern medicine, doctors would diagnose diabetes by *tasting* their patients' urine for sweetness. I am unfortunately [not joking](https://blog.sekisuidiagnostics.com/dxdialogue/diagnostics/2017/12/16/evolution-diabetes-testing-taste-test). That kind of dedication to medicine is very humbling to think about. They weren't sexual fetishists or crazy. They, like most of us, had no wish to taste someone's urine. Yet they did, so as to diagnose and treat patients. What amazing people they must have been. They were perhaps the only people at the time who could say ""This ale tastes like piss!"" in a pub and be believed.",1650821891,t1_i60qmms,/r/diabetes/comments/uajjha/prob_one_of_fav_memes/i60wyph/

Every T1 diabetic needs insulin and in the USA it is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ many people. 1/3 of t2 diabetics need insulin and it is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ many people. \n\nYou may also want to look into insulin types. Basal (long acting) and Bolus (short acting) are used for different reasons and may vary by diabetic. Often what is used, is what is covered by insurance, not that it is the best option for diabetics. If you can get your hands on annual reports from insulin manufacturers, they probably have a lot of interesting data.

Hundreds of units per day isn't unheard of. It's more likely to be basal insulin in T2D, but some need bolus insulin as well. \n\nAs a result, I'm sure the raw number of units of insulin dispensed (most vials are 1000u, most pens are \~300u, IIRC) by type skews more heavily towards T2D than the raw breakdown of numbers would predict.

Literally the NEXT morning after my first serious weights session, I had a morning reading of 86. Now my morning BGs run between 80-120, as long as I lift 3-4 times a week.

i5zaic1,ua4hm7,"Kind of funny, but right before I saw this post I was just commenting on another post elsewhere about having trouble with registering hunger sensations! As a totally separate lifelong issue, from well before my pancreas decided to pack it in. Same with realizing I'm thirsty. (Or needing to pee or get some sleep, before it starts turning critical.)\n\nThough, of course that really doesn't play well with the diabetes sometimes! As you can maybe imagine. It also serves as a slightly unusual form of reduced hypo awareness. I do just tell professionals now that I have trouble recognizing lows, because it's true. Finally getting access to CGM technology has been priceless, especially combined with a smartwatch for various alarms besides the handy glucose display. Harder to tune out reminders when they're buzzing on your wrist!\n\nWeirdly enough, though, before my diabetes was properly diagnosed and treated? The sky high blood sugar levels were enough to override my natural tendencies there. I was suddenly constantly starving, and the gnawing hunger and drsperate thitst got super distracting. And I could tell that not many people I brought it up to recognized just how big a change from the baseline ""normal' that really was.\n\nOnce my blood sugar got back under some control, though? It was straight back to often just getting caught up in other stuff and forgetting to eat/drink if I don't set reminders. I do get some hungry days when my blood sugar is acting screwy, but nothing like it was for a while there. But yeah, I do seem to be sort of unusual there, from what a lot of other people have been saying.\n\n(ETA: No clue how amylin or other hormones might tie into all this, but it's certainly an interesting question.)",1650790137,t3_ua4hm7,/r/diabetes/comments/ua4hm7/do_you_experience_hunger/i5zaic1/

Somewhere the reduced carb intake and a sustained ketotic metabolism must have reduced the hunger. I don't overdo the fat intake as I am hypertensive so don't want to push my luck but, as much as a Keto breathalyser is probably not too accurate, it does confirm I'm ketotic.

While this is true in some cases, the real culprits are the insurance companies.  Insurance pays all the bills, so they set the prices of the market.  Insurance doesn‚Äôt care how much a specific item like insulin costs, they only care about how much money they take in as premiums and how little they have to pay for services.  They will screw anyone at anytime to avoid paying.  \n\nObamacare was basically written by the insurance lobby to solidify their monopoly, ensuring no competition can ever ruin their usual business practices of screwing their customers.  In fact, it forced every American into buying into this already broken ponzie scheme we call healthcare!  This incestuous relationship between lawmakers and big insurance corporations has done nothing but drive costs skyrocketing for the past decade.\n\nTLDR: insurance companies bad.

Are you really going to blame Obamacare for something that literally started decades before it existed?  And, if anything, it looks like Obamacare improved things.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Obamacare limited the amount of profit that insurance companies can make.

So no, this wasn't written by the insurance lobby to solidify their monopoly.  \nAnd finally, as a diabetic, you have a pre-existing condition.  You had roughly a 100% chance of being denied coverage because of your preexisting condition prior to Obamacare, if you ever tried to purchase your own policy (outside of an employer or medicare).

i5vwf16,u9wly8,"Thanks and let me speak to these. The Biden administration just stated again that student loans are going to be addressed. He's a year into his first term and had so much they were forced to prioritize. Psaki didn't mince words on student debt relief though. Are you watching their press conferences? I highly recommend checking them out as they have been very informative and quite frankly, uplifting. On fracking we have a huge stick in the spokes with Russia. We need whatever natural resources we have right now as a matter of National security as we had to shut down Russian oil imports as part of the sanctions on Putin. We'll get to a balanced state with our supplies of fossil fuels and transition to renewables and will then be able to focus back on that environmental priority. As far as healthcare he helped create and install the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health care reform law and its amendments. The law addresses health insurance coverage, health care costs, and preventive care. As a result 31 million more people have healthcare. To emphasize how successful this program has been between 2010 and 2016 there was a 41% decrease in the amount of nonelderly *uninsured adults!

i5vhbdf,u9vx6f,"You can manage this but some people avoid conventional ADA type of medical recommendations because they believe they don‚Äôt actually help. For example‚Ä¶\n\nTesting: Test your blood glucose levels more often than what they tell you so you can make treatment decisions. Often drs. say to check in the morning only, or just 3 times a day. My advice is to check when you wake up, before eating meals, 1-2 hours after meals, and at bedtime. Plus any time you suspect you might be low or high. Checking 1-2 hours after eating helps you see how foods you eat are affecting you glucose levels. Your bg should be back at pre-eating levels by 3 hours after a meal. Keep a log or diary where you record your bg, carb count and insulin (if using).\n\nEating: Most conventional diets recommended for type 2 are too high in carbohydrates. The lower carb you can eat, the more stable your glucose levels will be. What you consider lower carb can vary, you don‚Äôt have to be extreme, just make wise food choices and avoid foods that shoot your blood glucose levels up. Research on glycemic index is helpful in determining which foods are best for you. Trial and error ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù by checking your glucose and keeping a food diary to see how foods affect you is helpful. You can occasionally splurge on higher carb treats by eating lower carb meals at other meals that day, combining high carb foods with protein foods to soften the spike, timing your insulin to when you eat, etc. \n\nExercise: exercise is extremely helpful for lowering insulin resistance and helping your body to use the insulin it produces more effectively. You don‚Äôt have to run a marathon, but taking a walk every day can really help. \n\nMedications: traditionally doctors prescribe Metformin at first for people with type 2. This medicine can cause a lot of people to have digestive problems. If this happens to you,  you can switch to extended release and make sure you take it with a meal. That can lessen some of the unpleasant side effects.\n\nUnfortunately with type two, the education you receive is often very poor. It is a disease where you must do your own research and be your own advocate. The bar is pretty low for what is considered standard treatment and if you want to see things improve you may have to go above and beyond what your doctor tells you to do. Can you manage it?

i5wxp37,u9vx6f,"High insulin during a lifetime is one of the biggest causes of insulin resistance. Continuing to shoot insulin makes type 2 a progressive disease. Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed 20 years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates. But, I am not your physician and did not tell you this"". 20 years later I am still on a extremely low carb diet. I eat about 20 grams per day. I started this diet journey by stopping all carbohydrates. I went through withdrawal for 3 days. It felt awful. After 3 days it was like a miracle. I felt better than I had in so many years. It was like I had 20 years taken off my age. I felt so good that it was a long time before I would even eat anything green.  \n  \nI highly recommend Metformin to help with your journey. I prefer the ER version. It is cheap and has proven itself over the decades. Metformin does not allow you to go ahead and eat carby stuff that is bad for you. It just helps perhaps with most people by knocking off 10 points from your BG meter.  \n  \nUse your meter often! believe your meter. If you want to know how a food affects your BG, you need to eat a portion that you would normally eat and then measure every 15 minutes for 2 to 3 hours. You need to detect the spike. Spikes count. Any reading over 140 begins irreversible cellular damage. Taking your BG 2 or 3 hours after you eat does not tell you what you need to know in order to stay healthy and expect the same lifespan as a non-diabetic.  \n  \nContinuing to eat carbohydrates and covering it with insulin or a pusher, will eventually cause serious complications and effect your quality of life in a seriously negative way.  \n  \nI realize you do not want to hear this. Taking this advice will demand serious change. Most of us hate change. I hate change.",1650743359,t3_u9vx6f,/r/diabetes/comments/u9vx6f/hey_guys_i_was_diagnosed_with_type_2_diabetes/i5wxp37/
i5ujlk5,u9vx6f,"I've been a Type 1 for 22 years now. I've was on a pump for about half that time, and a cgm for the past 4 years. Thankfully technology has improved significantly since I was first diagnosed and since you're just a Type 2, it should be significantly easier to control. \n\nBut do keep in mind, you must always keep your diabetes at the top of your priorities list. My younger sister became a nurse because of me and even started out her career in thr step-down icu at a hospital. There she dealt with diabetics in DKA daily (look it up if you don't already know about it) and she told me about a lot of the struggles of her patients. She's seen A LOT of amputees, and sadly most were Type 2's. Even one guy was so bad, that for the first time they allowed a patient to use their CGM to check their blood glucose because he had so many amputations that the only spit they could reliably check his blood sugar from were his ear lobes. \n\nI've unfortunately gone into DKA probably 2 dozen times and it is NOT pleasant. One time in 2005 when I was fifteen, my pump stopped working, but wasn't reporting any issues. I spent a day and a half in my bed throwing up everything that I tried to take in. Eventually I switched to gatorade because at least it had some flavor to counteract the bile. When I was finally admitted, my blood sugar was 934 and I quickly slipped into a coma. I only found out many years later how bad my situation really was. According to the doctors in the ICU, I should have died. I don't remember what blood test it was, but apparently the normal range is somewhere in thr 20's, and the doctors said they've lost kids my age around 15, mine was in the low 5's. My brain was also started to swell and was only about 1mm away from hemorrhaging to my spine and I would have been a vegetable the rest of my life. \n\nI'm not trying to scare you, But I just want to inform you of the consequences of taking this too lightly.

Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed 20 years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates. But, I am not your physician and did not tell you this"". 20 years later I am still on a extremely low carb diet. I eat about 20 grams per day. I started this diet journey by stopping all carbohydrates. I went through withdrawal for 3 days. It felt awful. After 3 days it was like a miracle. I felt better than I had in so many years. It was like I had 20 years taken off my age. I felt so good that it was a long time before I would even eat anything green.  \n  \nI highly recommend Metformin to help with your journey. I prefer the ER version. It is cheap and has proven itself over the decades. Metformin does not allow you to go ahead and eat carby stuff that is bad for you. It just helps perhaps with most people by knocking off 10 points from your BG meter.  \n  \nUse your meter often! believe your meter. If you want to know how a food affects your BG, you need to eat a portion that you would normally eat and then measure every 15 minutes for 2 to 3 hours. You need to detect the spike. Spikes count. Any reading over 140 begins irreversible cellular damage. Taking your BG 2 or 3 hours after you eat does not tell you what you need to know in order to stay healthy and expect the same lifespan as a non-diabetic.  \n  \nContinuing to eat carbohydrates and covering it with insulin or a pusher, will eventually cause serious complications and effect your quality of life in a seriously negative way.  \n  \nI realize you do not want to hear this.

The caveat there is that my opinion is based in the fact that everyone has different genetic markers, everyone has different gut biomes, everyone has different metabolisms, etc. So do I believe there is such thing as reversal where a diabetic can go back to a 'normal' style of eating? No. First, define normal ;) But more importantly, I have seen enough research that at least suggests that there is a predisposition to developing T2 that requires attention and maintenance. I don't ever expect to be able to have a sandwich or fast food ever again - not just because of my diabetes, but because of a host of allergies and intolerances that cause inflammation that irritates my diabetes. Some people can get off the meds forever. I have enough going on that I would really be fine with being in your shoes someday: just on metformin, managing through careful diet and exercise. So yeah, I am in the reversal camp, just with a few asterisks.",1650759325,t1_i5xou2z,/r/diabetes/comments/u9t411/can_prediabetes_be_reversed/i5xvvkn/

I liken it to a peanut allergy. If you don't eat peanuts, you won't be sick, but just because you aren't symptomatic doesn't mean you can eat peanut butter now.

i5u6axh,u9ssj6,"I'm going on 20 years as a Type 1. I won't sugarcoat it (pun intended) it sucks. A lot. \n\nHowever, you will start to learn how your body responds to different foods. You'll develop patterns and learn how to balance your sugars. There will be really bad days, and they will tend to overshadow the good days because a good day as a diabetic just means you feel normal. \n\nAs others have said, look into a pump and a CGM if you can. It makes things a lot easier. It's still a lift and things won't ever really feel like normal, but you can get pretty close. In the meantime, there's a bunch of us fighting the good fight and sharing stories here. Just reach out. \n\nAs far as advice, I don't want to preach, but here's a few that I've learned: \n - Most people don't get diabetes. Try not to be mad when they ask ""should you be eating that"" and ""So do holidays suck because you can never have candy?"" If i may suggest, it's actually more fun to fuck with them a bit if they're insistent on being ignorant. \n - Don't try any ""miracle cures."" Pure distilled water, cinnamon, and hot sauce are not cures (yes these are all purported to cure diabetes). It's just hard work that keeps us balanced. \n - Always have your kit with you. Diabetes takes a toll on mental health. A lot. Making sure you don't feel anxious all the time by not having easily accesible insulin, monitoring, and sugar on hand. \n - Take a break once in a while. Don't talk to people about it. Buy a bag of pork rinds and go to town (no carbs). \n\nBest of luck. Keep the faith and make your dead pancreas your bitch.",1650685414,t3_u9ssj6,/r/diabetes/comments/u9ssj6/firsttime_post/i5u6axh/

I was horrified and devastated. I also had asthma and always wished that I was ""Normal"" because I could run around and play without having to take several puffs of my inhaler just to breathe. Not to mention the constant asthma attacks and being stuck at home using a nebulizer. So now I had another incurable disease that would also rule my life. \n\nIt will be hard, and frustrating.

i5t3xe6,u9mv7g,"As the wife of someone with T1, the best advice I was given was don't be a backseat diabetic. Because it's not your body, it's super easy for the other person to get defensive if they \*feel\* like you're saying ""you're managing your diabetes poorly, I can do it better"" (even if that's not what you're saying at all). \n\nYou'll have to find ways to help and support without being outwardly like ""Did you check your blood"" .. ""Did you take insulin"" etc. It can feel like nagging on both sides. Instead, for example, when you're making food at home, look at the various nutritional labels and say something along the lines of ""FYI There's 15g of carbs in this"" which should make them realize they haven't taken insulin yet for their upcoming meal.  If you see them starting to get sweaty or agitated, don't say ""you're getting irritated, are you low?"", ask if you can get them any juice/tabs/their preferred type of glucose because their skin is looking a little clammy. Similarly if you notice they haven't taken insulin for something with a lot of carbs, you can say ""man, do you even have enough insulin for this??"" Joking can often take the edge off it.\n\nAs others have said, getting a GCM and pump are ideal because it's not left up to them or to you to say ""did you do XYZ"". It can also really alleviate nighttime issues which can often be scary. Using a CGM will also hopefully reduce the major BS swings and extended highs which are most likely contributing to his poor mental health. It takes a huge toll on your body and makes sense why they feel like shit all the time.\n\nAlso a good endo is crucial for dialing in basal rates and giving good management advice. If he's open to it, ask if you can come to an appointment so you can ask any questions too. I asked about how to estimate carbs for meals without nutritional labels, what forms of glucose are best for what situations, what do I do if I come across him at a low that we can't bring up (this was an issue one superbowl after my SO took insulin for the food but didn't account for the fact that alcohol/the liver can also affect BS) etc. It will hopefully be informational to both of you.\n\nIf any of his management issues has anything to do with shame about having diabetes (which is something that I have noticed a lot in my interactions with diabetics and their SO's and is incredibly frustrating to me because why???), you should make it clear that you don't see it as a hindrance in your life and it's nothing to be ashamed of. If anything, you find it cool dating a cyborg. Also let him know that you're in it with him, that there can be consequences of not managing your diabetes and it affects both of you and you ""want him around forever"". \n\nBeing involved but not pushy is crucial and not always easy. Sorry this ended up being a novel but thought I'd be open about some things I've learned after being with my T1 SO for 10 years.

My usual process was to eat a healthy dinner, give yourself and hour or so to digest and start with stable blood sugar. I never felt the need for more than 2 tabs, but start small, even 1/2 if you're nervous. You can always take more. It's also pretty enjoyable to not be blitzed out of your mind. There's a lot to appreciate on LSD and I think it's better to take less and remember the experience with more clarity. If you don't wear a CGM, set an alarm to test every 2 hours. Drink plenty of water and have snacks on hand. I found that clear, fruity candy is good and non-scary...some foods are weird when tripping. I used to cover a lot of distance tripping, walking miles around the city. Be aware if you are getting a lot more exercise than usual.\n\nAdvice to anyone tripping for the first time, diabetic or not: Do it with people you are really comfortable around. It's not a bad idea to have a sober ""guide"" for the group. We'd take turns. Make sure your phone is charged and carry a charger if you're wandering.

As a type 1 myself, it really makes me feel noticed when my wife asks ""what can I do for you today/ in this moment"" this helps me set how I want the day to go when it comes to managing my diabetes, but also in the moments when I'm high or low and can't directly do or think to do something, it allows me to communicate to her I need something such as sugar, meter or insulin. \n\nBe patient, I know you will have lots of questions, if she gets annoyed don't get mad at her. It could be that she has faced the same questions numerous times before and for myself, I have had hard times answering at times because sometimes it can be all too much.\n\nAllow her to share what she wants with you and don't push. When she is ready if she hasn't at this point, let them open up to you and share. \n\nRead up on it or do what you are already doing and ask questions! My wife reads up lots to keep herself informed. It shows me she cares - heck, she married me so I know she does! \n\nIf you guys really get into it, and look down the line into marriage, attending appointments may help, - it did for us so my wife could get an understanding of Bolus and Basal on a pump, carb ratios and corrections. We have been around eachother long enough that she can now tell if I'm high or low by the change in my skin tone. She states I go a little yellow when I'm high, and flush when I'm low and she senses it before I do sometimes. - this I am extremely thankful for, and even my mother I can tell is too. Something I don't think she ever picked up on after managing diabetes with me for 11+ years. \n\nLast but not least.

i5q1a9j,u96d24,"There is LADA, MODY 1-5, Gestational, Neonatal, Pancreatic Cancer, Kidney Disease, and others.  There is also a theory that Alzheimers is a type of Diabetes.\n\n5 to 15 is a blood glucose number from a prick test. \*The glucose value in mg/dl or mmol/l is displayed on a digital display. The preferred measurement unit varies by country: mg/dl are preferred in the US, France, Japan, Israel, and India. mmol/l are used in Canada, Australia and China. Germany is the only country where medical professionals routinely operate in both units of measure. (To convert mmol/l to mg/dl, multiply by 18. To convert mg/dl to mmol/l, divide by 18.) Many meters can display either unit of measure; there have been a couple of published instances\[citation needed\] in which someone with diabetes has been misled into the wrong action by assuming that a reading in mmol/l was really a very low reading in mg/dl, or the converse. In general, if a value is presented with a decimal point, it is in mmol/l, without a decimal it is most likely mg/dl.\* <= from Wikipedia  \n\n[Easy conversion chart here](https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/diabetes-education/diabetes-learning-center/conversion-table-blood-glucose-monitoring)\n\nFrom 5 to 10 mmol/l or 90 to 180 mg/dl is what my Canadian Endo set my glucometre at.  My American one took one look at my Canadian numbers and said ""I can't read this"" even though there's a BIG GREEN BAND that says ""this is the normal range.""\n\nEngage rant mode\n\nOfficial diagnosis from my Canadian family doctor when I was 15 - Hypoglycemic. \n\n Official diagnosis from my Canadian family doctor at 46  - Type 2. He put me on metformin and upped my dose once and I kept on hitting dangerous lows. Family doctor refused to look at other possibilities like LADA or MODY because ""Canada doesn't recognize them as anything but Type 2."" Or, as I like to theorize ""go away kid, yer bothering me with all your googling.""\n\nOfficial diagnosis from my first Canadian Endo (the one I like) ""I don't know what you have but it isn't Type 2"" and told me to NEVER go on Metformin again. \n\nMy second Canadian Endo, who I never actually met and only did a telecall, did not give me a diagnosis, and told me to try a carb blocker.  \n\nMy partner's sister (a retired diabetes researcher) diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia after looking at several of my charts. My Canadian family doctor finally reluctantly agreed that I had that too when I gave him her credentials. \n\nAn American NP put me on lipitor. American Endo (more in a bit) said that I was ""insulin resistant"" and to use intermittent fasting and not go on lipitor. American Cardiologist said lipitor was a No. I'll trust two specialists over an NP any day.\n\nThe American Endo has me very concerned about her treatment plans when she refused to look at my Canadian mmol/l numbers.  ""I can't read this. I don't know what the numbers mean.""  I like the Canadian numbers because 5-10 make sense to me.  She completely dismissed anything I said. She ranted about intermittent fasting and I curled up in the chair not wanting to do it and was just about crying. ""Do it. You'll loose weight."" \n\nExcept I haven't.  It's been over a month and I have been doing 4kg/10lbs bounce. I am on an up to 18/6 schedule with a tiny break so that I can take one of my heart meds late at night so I won't die because it must be taken with food. Not doing so is very bad the next day. Most days I do 16/8 or better.  I have cut out all that I can of carbs, changed to sugar free drinks and am eating a very keto diet and still the scale hasn't moved.\n\nMy fasting glucose was 151 mg/dl on January 31. My fasting glucoses have gone from a high of 11 mmol/l to as low as 6.6 mmol/l. It was 7.9 mmol/l this morning, so it has dropped, but I know it isn't enough for that American Endo. I see her again next month and if I still haven't lost weight and my numbers are still falling, I will be having words with her.  She even dismissed that my mother died of pancreatic cancer and her father had hypoglycemia too. Nope. The American Endo's diagnosis: I'm obese and need to loose weight and then I'll no longer be diabetic.\n\nExcept... I weighed a lot less when I was younger and had symptoms just as bad then too.\n\nI've watched my libres do freefalls after the fact when I felt dizzy or was bumping into stuff a lot.  Getting angry is another symptom.  So is an irregular heartbeat. Sweating.  Not being able to use the freestyle libres anymore because too many have failed sucks and I hate pricking, but I do love my [Genteel lancing device.](https://www.mygenteel.com/pages/instructions?hv=nwrcd) That makes BG tests so much easier.\n\nTL;DR; Diagnosis as ""some sort of diabetic, but we're not sure what exactly so loose weight.""",1650613209,t1_i5pt863,/r/diabetes/comments/u96d24/we_all_know_the_symptoms_of_high_and_low_but_what/i5q1a9j/

i5plxzg,u94ql3,"I work at a retina specialist office so I have a bit of info on this‚Ä¶\n\nThere are a couple different kind of lasers we use that do a couple different things. First off it‚Äôs not anything close to lasik. Lasik is the front of the eye we work all in the back of it. One laser is pretty minor and is called a Focal or a Grid PASCAL laser‚Ä¶ that one is for minor swelling and usually can have some pretty good results depending on severity and how early the edema is found. \nThe other one used on diabetics is for abnormal blood vessel growth in areas around the retina (neovascularization) and can happen all over the periphery or even the disc‚Ä¶ regardless we use a PRP for that one (pan retinal somethin somethin) and that is a bit larger of a laser that pretty much will go all around the periphery of the eye to halt any abnormal blood vessel growth. (The idea here is that these abnormal blood vessels grow and continue to grow and release signals to the body that can do all sorts of stuff‚Ä¶ plus they like to bleed when suuuuper bad and that is no bueno obvi.) both PRP and focal use a little lens to focus the light and it is placed up against your eyeball, but they should drop with some topical lidocaine so that shouldn‚Äôt be uncomfortable. Bright flashes after that and some disorientation but we don‚Äôt ever hear too many painful complaints if at all.\nWe do tons and tons of injections and a new drug was recently released that has had awesome results compared to what was here even 3 months ago. Problem with those tho is we see patients that get these injections at regular intervals so it‚Äôs not normally a one and done thing. They are effective though and treat similar stuff.\n\nAlso, just cause you were sent to a specialist doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you will have to have any of this. We get referrals all the time and half the time the patient is fine but we encourage improving A1c‚Äôs and that helps everything.\n\nIn regards to the dye, we use fluorescein angiography or FA (it is a red dye and you will get to urinate super yellow for like a day cause of it so don‚Äôt be alarmed lol), we rarely see reactions to them but they are always possible. Good luck with the stick, typically the people that do them do them 30+ times a day but we even have some peeps that are better then others. Also lots of bright lights:D (I kinda suck at sticking people for it lol). Really tiny needle tho typically injected into the top of your hand‚Ä¶ every now and then we go AC just depending on patient. Please drink water and make it easier on the tester and yourself lol. They will also do a scan called an OCT more then likely to show you layers of your retina (real word sucks so OCT it is) ((also this has no bright lights so real easy for you))‚Ä¶ this will show off edema very clearly as well as how much undulation you have, and the FA will light up where spots are bleeding, or leaking from edema.\n\nHope everything is good and you just have a couple scattered micro aneurysms which don‚Äôt matter that much (I even have some)",1650602100,t3_u94ql3,/r/diabetes/comments/u94ql3/is_laser_eye_surgery_awful_im_incredibly_nervous/i5plxzg/

Heck, I can't handle the light dr uses to look inside my eye with. It thoroughly sucks. I have to wear sunglasses all the time outside, even in cloudy weather. Sometimes inside, too, depending on the lighting environment.\n\nIf your dr suspects retinopathy and it's in the early stages, get it treated! Mine was caught too late and now it's only a matter of time before I'm fully blind.  \n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add, don't think of the procedure as a surgfery.

He gave me several small, mostly painless injections around my eye, then He stuck about a 3-4 inch needle in my eye socket (under my eye) and injected directly into my optic nerve. My wife was there with me holding my hand and I almost broke her hand it hurt so bad! I couldn't drive afterwards for a day or 2\n\nI had this treatment 3-4 times, and then the guy retired. I was referred to another Dr\n\nI go to first visit with the new Dr, he gives me the few small shots, and says he is about to do the laser. I ask ""shouldn't my wife be here to take me home? Don't you need to do the big shot?""\n\nHis response was they don't do it that way anymore.

The blood work doesn't just pop out a binary answer of you have diabetes or you don't.  The doctor factors in what they see on the blood work (that has some error in it) and looks at your symptoms and checks vs what the text book says your symptoms will be.

At the very least you should be able to speak with a medical professional over the phone about your test results. You should be able to get a copy of the results and find out the actual values. Then you could come here and post the values and get feedback about what they mean.\n\nI'm not familiar with the laws in the UK, but I assume you have the right to get a copy of your medical records or at least your test results. That's where I would start. Ask for a copy of the test results themselves.\n\nWhen I go to a lab here in the US they actually have my results the next day available online, and I can go to their website and see each test result with the exact number, and what the desired range is, and what the test means. I can also download it as a PDF.\n\nSo I would look to at least get your test results. Ask if you can go in there and pick up a copy from the front desk. But the way they're treating you is just insane!\n\nAlso, the main test that tells you how well your blood sugar has been doing is called an HbA1C test. Here in the US pharmacies sell at home test kits for an hba1c test. I assume it might be the same in the UK. While those tests might not be as exactly accurate as a lab test, they would at least give you a good idea. \n\nSo if you don't mind spending a little money you could check with your Pharmacy if they have an at home test kit for an hba1c test, or if they could administer the test themselves. Some pharmacies do that. That would at least tell you where you're at in general, even though it wouldn't tell you what type of diabetes you might have.

About a year ago my brother found a lump that he thought maybe cancer and I promise you, they told him to ring back in 4 months and see if it's got any bigger. I was dumbfounded. I won't lie it, did just disappear, probably a twisted glad, but I thought it was a case of catch it sooner rather than later, better safe than sorry? Not anymore with our doctors.\n\n Its commonly said around most people here that they aren't fit for purpose anymore, with no obvious explanation as to why. I've honestly spoken more to the receptionist than I have my doctor in the last 2 years, and sometimes it's been that bad you have to ring the non-emergency number to force the doctor to make you an appointment.

i5nete7,u8s9ty,"Most likely the dawn phenomenon. Put simply a combination of the liver releasing stores of sugar to give you energy when you wake, and certain hormones also being released which give rise to a period of insulin resistance.  Both natural events which arent a problem for non-diabetics, but very unhelpful if you are. \n SEE THIS UK LINK https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blood-glucose/dawn-phenomenon.html\n\nI have been type 1 for 34 years and had trouble with this for the last 3 years.  I was on Lantus until very recently and had to inject 4 units of rapid acting insulin every morning (even though I ate nothing for breakfast) to avoid the spike.  I switched to Tresiba 3 weeks ago which has massively helped, but I can still get a spike in the morning (albeit reduced).   \n\nPutting this dawn issue aside, I have to say switching to Tresiba has been my best diabetes decision in recent years. It has a much longer action (24-42 hours) compared to Lantus (16-24). Lantus had been fine for me until about 3 years ago, when I started to suddenly experience the dawn effect (had no issue with it until then). I tried everything to make Lantus work (split doses, different times, different doses) because I had used it for 20+ years until that point. I just couldn't get it to work.\n\nAfter a few weeks of trial and error getting the dose right with Tresiba the difference has been significant. Despite currently having Covid (tested positive 4 days ago) my in target time for the last 7 days has been 84%.\n\nOf course we are all different, and  am only offering my personal experience  with the issue you describe. You should of course only take advice from your physician.

i5r3e08,u8o5cc,"Need some more info.  You say his diabetes isn't under control, what kind of numbers are we talking about here?\n\nInsulin is a tough medication, it introduces a whole new factor to life of avoiding low blood sugar and varying absorption rates and all other sorts of factors.  Typical low times are at night (too high basal shots are often prescribed by doctors, since they're essentially shooting blind without CGM data) and while walking around (Low intensity exercise).  Will the cost of having to watch out for the lows be worth the benefits?  \n\nThat said, other than the lows, insulin has basically no side effects, since it is also a naturally produced hormone.  \n\nIf he's truly constantly high all the time, then yeah, insulin is a good way to go (solving any underlying causes if solvable is better, ofc).  (But, moderately high BG in the late 60's is pretty common and not necessarily a bigger deal than most of the other problems you've listed.)\n\nAs to why your dad's dr hasn't prescribed it (if your Dad is truly uncontrolled and has been for a while), I can only conjecture.  There's definitely resistance to give it due to the low risk.  But, also there is not great compliance in t2d patients with giving themselves the  insulin shots.  So, maybe the dr doesn't think it's worth trying if the case isn't really bad?  Other than that, I can't really think of a reason.  I had always thought it was patients more resistant to taking insulin than drs being resistant.  (A lot of studies done into how to get t2 patients to take insulin.)",1650637395,t3_u8o5cc,/r/diabetes/comments/u8o5cc/trulicity_plus_metformin_when_is_it_appropriate/i5r3e08/
i5x0rem,u8o5cc,"High blood insulin levels during a lifetime is one of the biggest causes of insulin resistance. Continuing to shoot insulin makes type 2 a progressive disease. Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed 20 years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates. But, I am not your physician and did not tell you this"". 20 years later I am still on a extremely low carb diet. I eat about 20 grams per day. I started this diet journey by stopping all carbohydrates. I went through withdrawal for 3 days. It felt awful. After 3 days it was like a miracle. I felt better than I had in so many years. It was like I had 20 years taken off my age. I felt so good that it was a long time before I would even eat anything green.  \n  \nI highly recommend Metformin to help with your journey. I prefer the ER version. It is cheap and has proven itself over the decades. Metformin does not allow you to go ahead and eat carby stuff that is bad for you. It just helps perhaps with most people by knocking off 10 points from your BG meter.  \n  \nUse your meter often! believe your meter. If you want to know how a food affects your BG, you need to eat a portion that you would normally eat and then measure every 15 minutes for 2 to 3 hours. You need to detect the spike. Spikes count. Any reading over 140 begins irreversible cellular damage. Taking your BG 2 or 3 hours after you eat does not tell you what you need to know in order to stay healthy and expect the same lifespan as a non-diabetic.  \n  \nContinuing to eat carbohydrates and covering it with insulin or a pusher, will eventually cause serious complications and effect your quality of life in a seriously negative way.  \n  \nI realize you do not want to hear this. Taking this advice will demand serious change. Most of us hate change. I hate change.",1650744757,t3_u8o5cc,/r/diabetes/comments/u8o5cc/trulicity_plus_metformin_when_is_it_appropriate/i5x0rem/

It keeps them at a constant temperature and protects them from freezing/heat.",1650553107,t3_u8fflu,/r/diabetes/comments/u8fflu/how_long_can_insulin_be_out_of_the_fridge/i5mh6lr/

i5nuhev,u8fflu,"I've used insulin that was kept at room temperature for 3 months, no signal of degradation. Read many times that, if it is still clear (as opposed to forming crystals), it is good to go.

i5ofthf,u8fflu,"They unofficially can go a LOOOOOOOONG time room temperature.  I‚Äôm talking about a solid year and I have found they still work.  Just if they get excessively heated for days (sits in hot car, etc) that‚Äôs where the molecules break down and the efficiency of the doses MAY decrease.  Even then in a pinch, I have been completely out of insulin without realizing it and gave a dose off of a vial that fell in between my car seats probably a year beforehand.  I used it for a one off dose.  Worked perfectly.  I did toss it once I got more the next day but you‚Äôll be more than fine for your situation in my opinion.  \n\nI have easily gone 6 months with a vial at room temperature and it works just as well.",1650581719,t3_u8fflu,/r/diabetes/comments/u8fflu/how_long_can_insulin_be_out_of_the_fridge/i5ofthf/
i5lruji,u8fflu,"You can use insulin that‚Äôs been out longer than 30 days, but the potency won‚Äôt be as strong. I keep one vial out in my bag that I use to refill my pump at a time.

i5kvvhn,u8fflu,"Mine says to store at refrigerator temp basically. I was worried cause they had me get vaccinated before I walked off with me insulin. It was an 85 degree day in Texas, so it was pretty room temp (cool, not warm) by time I got home. It‚Äôs been staying in my fridge. I guess I was just wondering if being room temp would spoil or ruin the insulin",1650516695,t1_i5kvnoe,/r/diabetes/comments/u8fflu/how_long_can_insulin_be_out_of_the_fridge/i5kvvhn/

i5lyea3,u8fflu,"So you've never tested it but you're pretty sure it goes off?\n\nPart of the reason you smell Lysol in your insulin is that phenol stabilizes the insulin molecule, in addition to killing germs, allowing it to tolerate heat better.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, chemical reaction rates double for every 10 degree rise in temp.\n\nFrom a fridge at 5C to a room with 25C, you'd expect it to degrade four times faster. If it's good for 4 years at 5C, it's good for a year at 25C. Rule of thumb only.",1650544887,t1_i5lruji,/r/diabetes/comments/u8fflu/how_long_can_insulin_be_out_of_the_fridge/i5lyea3/
