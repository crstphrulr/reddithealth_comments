i6k5swt,ue0dxn,"Prednisone is just a temporary fix, a bandaid if you will. It helps get inflammation under control, but it‚Äôs not meant to actually treat the disease or be used long term. A lot of people take it occasionally with a bad flare but it does a number of nasty things to the body so it‚Äôs used sparingly. A lot of times it‚Äôs prescribed before diagnosis as a diagnostic tool to see how your body responds (if you do well on it it‚Äôs definitely something inflammatory) and it helps in the meantime before you get started on RA meds. Now that being said, you will absolutely need to go on meds, probably for the duration of your life. It‚Äôs not going to be prednisone, they‚Äôll most likely start you on plaquenil or methotrexate. Opting out of medication will be, I hate to put it this bluntly, but stupid. RA is a progressive disease that is attacking your joints. And this will lead to permanent damage. So trying to forgo medication just because you think you‚Äôre young and invincible might have you bedridden by 40. It sucks having to take these meds, but I‚Äôll take that over having debilitating joint deformities and not being able to get out of bed. I‚Äôd encourage you do to some research on the disease, and listen to the guidance of your rheumatologist. I‚Äôm also 28 btw.\n***Edit to add I missed the part where you said you‚Äôll still take RA meds, my bad my puppy was jumping all over me while I was trying to read this lol. Will also add I felt way better with the prednisone and the nasty side affects aren‚Äôt going to set in with just one taper.

I didn‚Äôt feel back to normal until I started Humira, however. \n\nYou have plenty of options for treating your RA that don‚Äôt involve steroids, but don‚Äôt think that RA is treatable without any intervention involving medication.

Fatigue is real and it sucks but pushing through it to get a 20-30 minute workout in is not going to hurt you at worst and at best will help lubricate the joints and eventually help with energy.  Sometimes it helps through the worst of it to break it up into shorter workouts.  Also this is just my personal experience as an ex runner - running was really tough before I was medicated.  I had to switch up and figure out different ways to get moving and get strong.  And to give you hope - I can run now, although I don‚Äôt very often because I realized I like it much less than I used to :) \n\nBasically it sucks waiting to see a specialist and then again waiting for meds to work.  But most of us have been through that long wait and survived.  Beyond exercise, the only thing that helped me was aleve and that was just a tiny dent in my pain until I got meds that worked.\n\nGood luck!",1651115729,t3_udcxha,/r/rheumatoid/comments/udcxha/what_helps_while_waiting_for_first_appointment/i6hmmqg/
i6hnz93,udcxha,"Ok lots of questions here so let me see how I can help lol. \nIf compression gloves help, keep wearing them. I have some wraps and actually just ordered some splinting because I have bad trigger finger in my pinkies from inflammation. \nI have no idea on stimulants, honestly not much is going to help your fatigue. I take omega 3 and d3+k2 for vitamins which are good for joints. An anti inflammatory diet is not going to fix your problems completely, but it may help a bit. My philosophy is eating healthy is never going to hurt. \nSome other pain management stuff you might try: Epsom salt baths, heating pads, and if your doc knows anything about it, prescription e-stim. I actually work for a prescription e-stim company (won‚Äôt say which as I‚Äôm not trying to sell ya here lol), but it truly does help my pain. You could also try some physical therapy or occupational therapy. PT will help a bit if you‚Äôve got some swelling or damage, OT will help if you need to figure out how to do some daily tasks with pain. Your primary doctor could do a referral for either of these.\nSomething else you might ask your primary about before seeing a rheumatologist is prednisone. They can give you a taper to help get rid of some of your inflammation and that is truly the only thing that‚Äôs helped my fatigue so far. I‚Äôm now off the prednisone and waiting for methotrexate to hopefully kick in and start working. \nAs far as exercise, man I feel you on this. I‚Äôve felt shitty for 2 years and completely fell off my gym routine. Try light activity for now. Walking. Maybe spin bike a bit. Swimming is great for joints if you have access to a pool. But be kind to yourself. If it feels like too much, don‚Äôt do it.

i6irgdp,udcxha,"As already said, if you can get started on prednisone that might be a real help.   \nBe careful with any over the counter NSAIDS to not exceed dosage and always take with food.  \nStarting out I'd force myself up in the morning into a hot shower to get the circulation going (inactivity, like, you know, sleeping, is the enemy for inflammation. ) Then on to ice packs to try to bring down the swelling in wrists and knee.  \nIf you can tough out the pain then you'll still have to be wary of fatigue so try to learn to pace yourself.   \nUnfortunately there's a lot to learn and even once you start on meds it might be a while before you find which one(s) work.   \nAll the best.",1651145493,t3_udcxha,/r/rheumatoid/comments/udcxha/what_helps_while_waiting_for_first_appointment/i6irgdp/

I'm not lecturing, I'm just being honest. \n\nSecondly, as someone with bipolar disorder, who has considered suicide, it ain't worth thinking about death when you're that young. It's just not. My body was ruined from farming, martial arts, sports, and a few freak accidents before I was your age. I still get around just fine. Even with bad hands, I still so martial arts, I hunt and do shooting sports, etc. It's not a death sentence to the things you love. \n\nMeds now are so much better than they were even 10 years ago. Early intervention is key. You can live much better off than your mother or even me. Seriously, you can. My grandmother has arthritis and she's happier now at 80 than she was at 40, even worh barely usable hands. \n\nYou'll be okay. You'll struggle but you'll handle it. Life will be good.

i66tymg,ubush8,"Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are very different. While osteoarthritis is based on wear and tear of the joints, rheumatoid arthritis is an immuno dysfunction where an immuno response triggers arthritis decay.\n\nThings you can do to prevent osteoarthritis, healthy fats, no sugars low starch intake, lots of fiber, bone broths, prebiotic and probiotic foods, antioxidants specifically glutathione. Intermittent fasting and water fasts. Ketogenic diet to help autophagy/cell repair and recycling.\n\nFor rheumatoid arthritis or any other autoimmune disease this is applicable as well, but autoimmune dysfunctions have deeper underlying  causes. Dr sarah ballantyne discribes it in her book the paelo approach. She wrotes that autoimmunity needs 3 factors. 1, genetic predisposition 2, trauma of sort like accidents, fractures, infections, or psychological trauma such as ptsd or abuse of any type, 3, one needs a leaky gut and environment triggers. Often environmental triggers cause the leaky gut to start with. The leaky gut is the point of contamination of environmental triggers like pestecides, herbicides, forever chemicals etc., or plant based triggers such as histamine/allergies or lectins like gluten for example. These compounds are able to get into the blood stream and cause the immune system to react. This is called molecular mimicry. Especially lectins, they are aminoacids and sugar molecules combined. The body identifies the lectins but mistakes the aminoacids for bodily tissue due to its similar molecular structure. And to be safe the body attacks all molecules that look somewhat alike. This makes the body/immune system to create and produce autoantibodies. \n\nWithout a leaky gut the body is unlikely to become autoimmune she suggests. Which brings us back to the diet part i started out with.\n\nIf you want to know more about lectins, research dr gundry the plant paradox \nAnd for autophagy and fasting resesrch dr pradip jamnadas",1650925169,t3_ubush8,/r/rheumatoid/comments/ubush8/hope_i_am_okay_asking_this_here_28m_how_to/i66tymg/

i67aogm,ubnuim,"\nThe first time I got COVID then 1-2 weeks later I had a lot of pain in my finger joints only and I also had some hand weakness, occasional finger joint swelling too. Was very bad for maybe three months or more then it would kind of come and go or just be present but not terrible. It wasn't until around 10 months post COVID was I more or less symptom free. Had no idea what was going on as I couldn't see a doc at the time. \n\nThe second time was god awful. Extremely painful joints, couldn't walk due to pain, couldn't use my hands, also had near total hand paralysis and I also couldn't see properly. It was really scary. That lasted about four months and sometimes it was everything and some weeks it was just my knees or just my hands. Now I am mostly fine again but have smaller flair ups when I over-do it and stuff like that but it should go away as long as I don't get COVID again. \n\nI had a nerve study done and we found that my muscles in my hands were not properly responding to the nerve signal coming in. I have not read anywhere about other people having this symptom but my doctor deduced that it was also the autoimmune response attacking my nerves/muscle connection in my fingers and eyes. This reactive autoimmune response can attack any system and it can be different for different people. \n\nApparently this has the potential to be worse each time you get COVID as it did in my case as the autoimmune response is stronger with each subsequent infection. They know this because there are other viruses that are prone to causing reactive autoimmune responses and it's been documented that for many the second infection causes stronger reactions for some reason. \n\nAlso I did not have any negative reaction to getting vaccinated. When they told me it was from a COVID reaction I was kind of like but then wouldn't this have also happened when I got vaccinated but apparently the vaccine does not cause this reaction. Though getting my booster shot did cause a bit of a flair up but only because I was already dealing with this autoimmune response.\n\nIf it's been pretty bad for eight months and it is reactive arthritis,  it could be that you got COVID twice. For me it didn't even cross my mind that it could be COVID related as it felt like I only had around six months actually symptoms free before the second attack came on so I figured it was an ongoing thing and more like a true autoimmune disease but thankfully it is temporary.

i64iqif,ubifdm,"*reposting comment because it said it was deleted* \nSulfasalazine is definitely safe during pregnancy. So is hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Also, biologics in the TNF inhibitor (Enbrel, Remicade, Simponi, Cimzia, and Humira) category are considered safe. They are also safe while breastfeeding. This is per the American College of Rheumatology. Even if you are well controlled and there‚Äôs a good chance of going into remission during a pregnancy, it‚Äôs important to keep disease activity under control. That can help lessen chances of complications. \n\nI‚Äôm currently trying to get pregnant. I‚Äôm on Humira and prednisone now. I failed all the meds in the TNF inhibitor category and Humira was my last option. It‚Äôs working for now. And I‚Äôm allergic to sulfasalazine and Plaquenil, so that limits what I can take. In my opinion, I think the benefits of medication and keeping disease activity controlled outweighs the risks of the medications and uncontrolled disease activity. Besides, I only want one child, so I want to be able to enjoy a pregnancy and not be miserable the whole time. Plus, if you stop and restart a medication, who knows if it will work the second time around. \n\nIf you have concerns about medications during pregnancy, you can always see if you can consult with a high risk OBGYN.

I had no issues until 6 weeks postpartum, when I did start to flare and immediately went back on both Humira and the methotrexate I had discontinued before getting pregnant.\n\nI looked up sulfasalazine and it can apparently inhibit the absorption of folic acid, which may be why your doctor would prefer you to be off it if you can.

i63cbar,uba8s9,"Here is what i do for my ra pains. First i try to keep pharmaceutical intake low, most pills mess with my gut and heavy pain meds like meloxicam for extended times bares the risk of gi problems.\n\n I do get muscle relaxers called cyclobenzaprine for muscle cramps and spasms. Cyclobenzaprine is a¬†centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant¬†structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants. Cyclobenzaprine relieves skeletal muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. In preclinical research, cyclobenzaprine reduced skeletal muscle hyperactivity. There were also studies done that found that it helps with rem sleep and sleep quality. Your doctor is more likely to talk about it if you discribe your stiff back muscles as cramping or spasms with general tightness.\n\nAlso ask your doc for physical therapy, they can teach you specific stretches and exercise to mitigate the weakness of the muscles. It slso shows your doc your not just out for drugs.\n\nYou probably need to go through a fair amount of pharmaceutical trails, but ask your doctor about biologics/immuno suppressive injections, they usually work well. They are very good at containing the joint damage and mitigating further deterioration.\n\nNatural pain relief i get from hydrotherapy, taking hot tubs twice a day or regular hot bath tubs to help get rid of stiffness and tight muscles. Epsom salt in the water helps as well.\n\nDepending on your state, my go to medicine is cannabis. And not just cannabinoids but also terpenes/fragrance compounds of the plants, specifically delta 3 carene wich helps aid musculoskeletal pain and damage. \n\nGenerally aromatherapy is a worth looking into to help with fatigue, depression, pain, relaxation and even sedation.\n\nConsider a ra friendly diet and plant based medicinal plants for your health, it has helped me most of all medications or pharmaceuticals. Though, nutural plant based medicine can also overwhelm the immune system. Plants like elderberry, echinacea etc. Essentially all immuno boosting plants you want to avoid.",1650861724,t3_uba8s9,/r/rheumatoid/comments/uba8s9/this_is_going_to_sound_silly_but/i63cbar/

i63sr2u,uba8s9,"Maybe just tell him your back is killing you and you aren‚Äôt sure if this is RA or muscle pain, and if you could try some heavy muscle relaxers since none of the over the counter stuff worked for you. Tell him that you haven‚Äôt been able to do even the simplest of tasks and someone needs to help you all the time when doing chores etc etc. \n\nI‚Äôve been diagnosed with RA five years ago, they put me on hydroxycholoquine and sulfasalazine at first and not methotrexate because I wanted to have kids. Unfortunately I was allergic to hydroxycholoquine, so had to it. The tried cimzia and was severely allergic to that too. Currently on simponi but that hasn‚Äôt yet been able to control the flares, pain, swelling, stiffness etc and everyday a new part of the body becomes and stays stiff and painful. I‚Äôve been in pain for so long and so much that now they have diagnosed me with having an acute fibromyalgia pain crisis. Unfortunately, meanwhile my RA hadn‚Äôt been in remission and it went and attacked my lungs. In between all these, the doc prescribed some muscle relaxers like naproxen all the while knowing my RA wasn‚Äôt in remission yet but that didn‚Äôt help even for a fraction of a second. So I had to go back\nAnd repeatedly say how despite my blood work coming relatively good I haven‚Äôt been good, couldn‚Äôt get up from bed, sofa, walk from\nBedroom to washroom etc. So now they put me on gabapentin which has helped to certain extent but not fully yet. Also, this is almost a narcotic and can‚Äôt stay on it too long if I want a relatively healthy life.

i60v5qv,uamn4q,"Ah ok I gotcha! Mine actually started in my hips, then moved to my shoulders, then hands, wrists, elbows. Typically RA will include pain/swelling in your hands or feet as this is the most common place it starts/affects. Also worth noting, inflammatory arthritis does not necessarily show up in x-rays and chiropractors are not trained to look for the stuff an autoimmune disease would show besides very obvious damage. You could still have AS in the early stages, your spine won‚Äôt immediately have damage if your disease has just started. Same with RA. I was lucky in that I caught mine early so I have zero damage so far in my joints. So just throwing that out there. But really the best option would be to see a rheumatologist because all of us RA folk can tell you all day long what our symptoms are but honestly each autoimmune case is unique, especially since you also have celiac. My rheum describes it as a lot of ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù. They‚Äôll look at a number of things when trying to diagnose RA: blood work, x-rays, length of symptoms, joints affected, and whether there‚Äôs visible swelling. Then they base the diagnosis off that. I‚Äôm seronegative so my blood work is totally normal, X-rays normal, but I have minor visible swelling and bilateral pain in multiple sets of joints. Make a list of your symptoms and how long they‚Äôve been present and see if you can get into a rheum, because while it‚Äôs hard to say what might be causing your symptoms and whether it‚Äôs RA, it‚Äôs definitely worth seeing a doctor and figuring it out.

So trying to differentiate what is causing which symptoms can be a pain lol. I‚Äôd make sure you have your full celiac history too when you see a rheum so they can help try and differentiate whether certain symptoms were from that or potentially from something else autoimmune going on.

i5zp9m1,uaiuwv,"Notes are a great idea. Just remember to emphasise the impact on your life. And, also, it's a process and a relationship - most things will require more than one visit. And as well, they are human and might jump to an assumption that you don't want something to be a big deal, or you do want something to be a big deal. So you might need to emphasise that something is a huge problem in your life, or you might need to emphasise that actually this other thing is NBD and you aren't interested in testing or whatever. But if they recommend something and you don't plan on following up, do tell them that. Usually they say ""oh, that's fine, I just thought you might enjoy a CT scan"", but sometimes they'll say ""it's actually pretty important you get this scan because I am worried about disease X and want to rule it out""",1650801911,t1_i5yetn8,/r/rheumatoid/comments/uaiuwv/im_21_and_feel_like_i_have_symptoms_of_ra_i/i5zp9m1/

i5xpv1a,uafuat,"A few things to know:\n\nThe #2 question sounds like their way of knowing if you have a disability under ADA. You may want to look up some examples of the major life functions and then write ones that sound most applicable. With my RA, I often explain that it impacts my ability to walk long distances, I cannot write with my hands, those sort of things. \n\nThe #3 question - tread lightly here‚Ä¶ your accommodations cannot cause undo burden to the company or change the essential duties of your job. If you have the listing of your job or other jobs at your company, you could look at that for reference. If there is a major function of your job that is difficult for you, word your answer with what modification would be most beneficial to make that major function easier (ex. Say an essential function is filling out forms or taking notes‚Ä¶ explain that you can do these things, but with the use of a computer, if arthritis in your hands limits your ability to do it by hand)\n\n\nPersonally, the accommodations I have at work are this:\nFlexible work from home: I can do most of my job from home. When the work is the same at home as it is in-office, then I am allowed to do my work from home. When the essential function of my job can only be done outside my home (some in person meetings, certain things with technology I don‚Äôt have, etc) then I am still required to go to that. Having this accommodation has been extremely helpful in managing my RA because at home I have all of the resources I need to manage it, and can sit on the couch, use heating pads, do PT stretches on breaks, etc. I formally negotiated this one with HR. \n\nI also have some accommodations that came out of conversations with my manager. I start later on Thursdays than on other days to accommodate PT, doctor appointments, blood draws, etc. I can use my laptop to take notes. If I am asked to go to something outside the office, they are aware that it might take me longer to get there, even if it‚Äôs walking distance, because I need to take my car and walking is slower for me some days. \n\nBest of luck, I hope you negotiate accommodations that work best for you!",1650756369,t3_uafuat,/r/rheumatoid/comments/uafuat/lost_on_accommodations/i5xpv1a/

Two months after that she added hydroxychloroquine because I still had so many inflamed joints. Then came injectable MTX. Then biologics. Right now I‚Äôm still on injectable MTX, HCQ, just started Humira (not my first biologic), and am supposed to be taking prednisone. \n\nMy first prednisone script was slow taper.

I also happen to be a medical rep so was luckily fairly well versed already in autoimmune diseases. I think you are right in that maybe it‚Äôs time to find a new rheumatologist, because they should really be walking you through every step of the way in this and helping you through side effects. Mine was very straight forward on the side effects and how long it could take to see results. It‚Äôs definitely a long haul unfortunately. I would not recommend forgoing treatment. Your symptoms may be manageable for now, but if you let your body go untreated and your immune system run rampant, you could one day find yourself waking up unable to get out of bed. The decline isn‚Äôt always gradual with this disease, it could suddenly hit you like a freight train and then the damage is done and it‚Äôs irreversible. Just something to really consider. My rheumatologist described rheumatology as a lot of ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù meaning there‚Äôs a lot left up to interpretation and it‚Äôs a ton of trial and error. There‚Äôs no one size fits all. I think in the meantime see what you can do to focus on pain management and see if you can find a rheumatologist that you are better matched with.

I was not super healthy before but some respiratory stuff they didn‚Äôt know what it was. Within the span of 4 weeks I was diagnosed with RA and Covid and then long haul Covid. Comparing the two?  Hard to do but covid just decimated my life, it‚Äôs still going on, namely chronic breathing and lung and terrible exertion/fatigue issues. I‚Äôve never encountered anything like it. It takes an immense amount of patience like RA ‚Äî- time and rest. All last year I was pretty bedridden while working remote, and that was an immense struggle, and also dealing with fun the new RA crap and the meds. To say the least I had some very dark times and thoughts. It was all really just one big gigantic monster. Then this year has been nothing but getting sick with infection after infection on top of it. tooth taken out? bad gum infection; weeks later a bad cold?  got a sinus infection, multiple antibiotics, dragged on for weeks. Waited to take Enbrel can‚Äôt start it on while infected. Started it, 3 weeks in, lungs really feeling better (it‚Äôs probably lung inflammation from both Covid and RA), hand swelling and pain way down, had one or one and a half good weeks in 14 months. Guess what? got a cold, which you guessed it, then went into sinus infection, which has now caused lung problems again. Can‚Äôt take Enbrel two weeks now, and have to wait two more weeks basically start over.

You got diagnosed 8 months ago and have already tried a handful of meds, but it doesn't look like you were on any very long. Most meds for RA take months to actually start working and aren't at ""full strength"" for 6-9 months.  You mention withdrawal a lot, but... That takes months to set up a dependency for the meds, not a few days, and is addressed by tapering the meds over time.

In my family, a few of us are taking thyroid medication despite normal thyroid testing, because we all had symptoms of hypothyroid, including fatigue, and the thyroid meds help. Maybe our bodies use thyroid hormones poorly? And Wellbutrin is a bit of an ‚Äòupper‚Äô.

i5rt06f,u9gpqv,"I (29M) had both of my hips replaced at the same time. The recovery period was longer for me as I had lost a ton of muscle from untreated RA and being in a wheelchair. The recovery itself consisted of a ton of physiotherapy, do everything they tell you to do it is absolutely crucial you don't skip steps.\n\nPost surgery there will be restrictions you'll have to follow which depends on the technique used and the surgeons preferences, for example you probably won't be able to flex your hips past 90 degrees or cross your legs. You'll have to prepare beforehand and make sure you have things like a raised toilet seat(preventing hip flexion beyond 90), a sturdy chair, hip cushions with an appropriate thickness for your height, grabbing sticks.\n\nThe main reason they do hip replacements is actually for pain and not for mobility. That being said, I've gained back so much. I'm able to go grocery shopping without mobility aids, I use an exercise bike and do squats with weights now. There are permanent limitations like not running or jumping to prevent early wear and tear of the prosthetics. My hip pain before the surgery was constant and excruciating, it was worse than kidney stones, but now over two years after I have next to no pain! With a lot of walking I sometimes get some muscle tightness around the hip, but I'm very happy with my mobility and function as compared to before.\n\nThe surgery isn't without risks so I strongly advise you to prepare beforehand by following all the directions your surgeons team provides as well as pre operative physiotherapy to strengthen your muscles and other joints which will make the beginning of your recovery easier.\n\nFor a bilateral hip replacement your recovery will take longer, factors like whether your RA is controlled by medications or not will impact the overall length.\n\nPhysiotherapy will be your best friend, find a physiotherapist you like as you're going to spend a lot of time with them haha.\n\nEvery person and situation is different but I would highly recommend this if hip pain has destroyed your ability to live comfortably and work.\n\nThe risk of complications will decrease over time, you'll have to be very careful not to bend too far early on, etc. Your surgeon will be able to tell you how long they except you to keep the restrictions. Keep in mind your surgeon wants this to be successful so they'll ultimately only recommend it if you're a good candidate high chance of a good outcome.\n\nThis must be a terribly stressful time for you.

i5rbolo,u9djxq,"Agree with the above. I‚Äôm newly diagnosed and starting methotrexate today, but my rheum was very honest in letting me know it will be an ongoing trial and error. Meloxicam and ibuprofen are only to mildly manage pain, they don‚Äôt actually treat anything autoimmune. I take meloxicam which helps a tiny bit. You‚Äôre going to have to wait it out for the sulfa and see if that helps, if not then it‚Äôll be onto the next med. Reality is it could take a year or two before you‚Äôre feeling 100%. In the meantime try and find some pain management methods that help you. Do you have any erosion or joint damage? Physical therapy might help a little if you do. I don‚Äôt have damage yet, but methods I‚Äôve used to manage pain are arthritis cream, meloxicam, heating pad, Epsom salt baths, and e-stim (IFC specifically) on whichever joint is hurting the worst. You could also try swimming a little (or just floating if exercise hurts) to take some pressure off your joints. I‚Äôve also tried to do less inflammatory foods. And some people swear by medical marijuana. Not my personal style but find what works for you. I work in medical sales so I‚Äôve been lucky enough to learn a lot of tips and tricks before my diagnosis lol.

Primary didn‚Äôt think I was anything but ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù and ‚Äúdepressed.‚Äù Got a second opinion from another physician, they thought it was likely I had it. Couldn‚Äôt find a pediatric rheum because all of the ones in my city weren‚Äôt accepting new patients. Finally found an adult rheum. Thought I was ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù RA but because it didn‚Äôt show in my blood, wouldn‚Äôt diagnose.

They diagnosed me in one visit  due to symptoms, scans and family history. \nHere‚Äôs a few suggestions I would give:\nIf you can afford to drive to a rheum even if they‚Äôre not within close distance, they might be able to at least diagnose and then manage most of your care by video call. My rheum sends test scripts to places local to me so I don‚Äôt have to drive 3 hours round trip for blood or scans. \n\nMake sure to ask for scans, too. I get yearly x-rays of major joints, specific arthritis ultrasounds of hands and feet. \n\nArthritis Foundation has a lot of good resources and information. Their website helped when I was seeking diagnosis.\n\nDon‚Äôt stop advocating for yourself. Keep emphasizing to your current doctors that you are in pain. Make sure to let them know if it prevents you from doing certain things. If they seem dismissive, ask for them to make a note in your chart that you came in with pain that day.\n\nAlso, if they have PAs or other doctors in their practice, maybe see if you could switch to them.

i5o94t5,u8wt58,"Yeah unfortunately it‚Äôs kind of a rabbit hole. Some other defining factors are how many joints are affecting you and how long you‚Äôve had symptoms. Your doc may not be denying that there‚Äôs something wrong, but it might just be too soon and too few symptoms to decide on anything definitive. I went two years with joint pain in my hips and shoulders, no visible symptoms. Then one day boom, hands were a bit swollen and more joints were involved. It‚Äôs unfortunately a bit of a waiting game. Also the medications to treat these diseases are real nasty, so she probably doesn‚Äôt want to put you on something if it‚Äôs not necessary yet. I‚Äôd say in the meantime, keep a journal of all your symptoms and try to find some things to manage your pain. Arthritis cream, hot & cold therapy, Epsom salts, Tylenol, all good options to try. As much as it sucks, maybe give it some more time and then see that doctor again. You might end up traveling for another doctor to tell you the same thing. There‚Äôs actually a grading scale that they use to diagnose based on blood work, X-rays, joints affected, and length of symptoms. So you might be early on enough that you‚Äôre just not checking many boxes.

i6bb5z3,u8wt58,"Hello,\n\nI have seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, have had it for six years, and for me, (and I understand this is not uncommon at all from everything I have heard) you would KNOW with prednisone and if it works and if your condition is inflammatory. Prednisone is a \*lifesaver\* to me, and without it, I would be in debilitating pain. It works on inflammation. If prednisone works for you, that means you have less pain and/or swelling; it probably most definitely means you have something inflammatory going on.\n\nThat's why I'm suspicious when you say you 'felt pretty good on it'; for me, prednisone takes away 100% of the pain and immobility. It also depends on the strength of prednisone. My pain/swelling responds to minimum 15 mg...for some that's a lot, for others, it's unfortunately normal. So if you're taking a low dose, say 5 mg, ask for more and see if you feel better. Seriously ask if you can take 20 mg or even more a day and if you feel absolutely pain free. If it's inflammatory the right dose of prednisone WILL make you feel normal/no pain.\n\nIt took many painful years to get the proper diagnosis, and again, without the prednisone and now methotrexate and a biologic, I would be nearly crippled as the pain is that bad. Pop 20 mg of prednisone, and I am 100% normal in about 6-12 hours. It's a miracle.\n\nJust from my experience, if prednisone WORKS, you most definitely have some sort of inflammatory arthritis going on.\n\nBest of luck and do NOT give up. I've had so many GPs not believe me, or give me a very low dose of prednisone, you really have to advocate for yourself.

My CRP was high, so she put me on plaquenil thinking it MAY be an inflammatory arthritis. That level has gone down and never have my levels or CRP gone up. Pain was mild over the next months, gripping strength was bad but obvious signs of swelling and and inflammation didn‚Äôt show up until 8 months later. Eventually went thru the dmards, 13 months later I need a biologic.

i6bebno,u8wt58,"I'm sorry but 5 mg is ridiculous. I feel slightly better with 10 msg of prednisone but still pretty painful. 20 mg and there is ZERO pain.\n\nMy (non-expert-but-having-this-condition) opinion is your condition is not inflammatory, or it is and she's giving you too low a dose so you can't accurately gauge. I am NOT a doctor, but I have this ratted condition. Can't stress enough (if it's inflammatory arthritis, negative or positive, and probably other forms like psoriatic, etc) you should be 100 pain-free on the right dose of prednisone. Ask for a higher dose (they hate prednisone), they'll probably be hesitant, but it should definitely be looked into. I promise you that's a very low dose that would not help me at all.\n\nI'm an otherwise healthy 39 year old male. Took them FOREVER to believe me, and now it's in my bloodwork and the rheumatologist is ""100% sure it's RA"". They will dismiss your pain. Your pain is real and expect doctors to not believe you until it shows up in bloodwork, or get a great doc.\n\nI have zero side effects from prednisone, so again, it is just a miracle pill to me. Best of luck.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference: NSAIDS don't work at all on my pain. Literally only prednisone and cortisone shots. I know different patients are different, but it would be one more clue that your pain/inflammation levels are too much for over-the-counter drug, if the NSAIDS aren't working on your pain.

Biologics are complex, highly targeted, and costly to develop and I do thank you for your efforts in your field.  Small molecule drugs are usually in pill form so easier to administer, cheaper, but also less targeted.  JAK-STAT signaling is very far-ranging.

i5kjffo,u85cfb,I have MCTD with sometimes joint flares. When I started lifting weights carefully I kept getting AC joint separation (basically the collar bones pop up and are super tender). Now sometimes even when I‚Äôm not working out my collar bones/shoulders just feel super bruised for no reason. I got a personal trainer who specialized in stuff like that and he had me do ‚ÄúSchwarzenegger presses‚Äù (cause Arnold Schwarzenegger invented it to stop himself from getting that problem) starting with low weights and working up. It built up the muscles around those joints and I never had a problem again until Covid hit and I stopped training.

i5bzpkb,u72gw2,">Does anyone have any thoughts or advice of whether this seems about right or if there‚Äôs anything I should say?\n\nFellow UK inflammatory arthritis person here, sadly what you describe is completely normal for NHS auto-immune condition treatment. The cheapest possible treatment is the default, to move up the treatments you have to fulfill a criteria -  either proving cheaper ones don't work, or proving a certain level of need. Each local NHS Trust has slightly different criteria for biologics, but they all follow the NICE guidance which is work through from NSAIDs, to DMARDS to biologics, in cost order.  It's not uncommon for a med to be swapped for a cheaper one, even if it's working well.\n\n(I'm on an unusual preventative for my asthma, it costs the NHS ¬£4.5 a month - even lower than the prescription fee I pay for it -  I'm routinely badgered to swap it for a cheaper one, even though the cheaper one has never worked.)\n\nDon't be surprised if you're asked to try MTX again with the cheaper biologic.\n\nAs for no urgency, currently waiting time for an urgent NHS Rheumatology appointment is about 6 weeks (differs slightly between hospitals), but that's for life or death urgent. Standard appointment waits are 10 months to 2 years. Follow-up for med changes are currently 3 to 4 months.\n\nWhat can you do?  If the hospital offers a between appointment nurse consult on-demand service, you could use that. Give them a call and explain the concerns, have a chat. They may give you steroids as you're in flare at the moment.  Alternatively, you could pay ¬£200 and buy a private consult with your rheumatologist. Or even pay and see a different rheumatologist, if you look at the UK arthritis FB groups you'll see it's not uncommon for people to pay to see a private rheumatologist and have that rheumatologist send the NHS one a letter saying you need to be seen quicker, or should stay on the more expensive biologic.\n\nTL;DR  NHS services are stripped to the bone and biologics are rationed very tightly.",1650370350,t3_u72gw2,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u72gw2/please_help_worried_about_biologic_switching_and/i5bzpkb/

They understand better than your average person, but most of them don't have to live with it.\n\n**Your boyfriend could literally be the best most considerate person ever, but if he can't make an effort to understand where you are coming from and consider the factors playing into your fatigue, it's worrying for the longevity of your relationship.** ESPECIALLY after you've just strained yourself with moving (which is already something that could cause you to need weeks or months of recovery time even if you were medicated) and he's aware you're not on any medications. There needs to be some understanding of your illness and both of you need to develop individual and shared coping mechanisms for the long term. Especially considering you've said his mom also had autoimmune issues and it may be triggering some pre-existing resentments. \n\n**Which again, is not to demonize him**. My last ex of nearly a decade was the most wonderful person, but these are exactly the kind of issues that wore us down over time. We parted on good terms, but it was still very painful for both of us. Ultimately, he couldn't handle the strain of the extended flares and fatigue. He didn't feel like he had a partner anymore and I couldn't exactly blame him, I wasn't much of a partner at that point. However, the strain would also have been greatly lessened if he had been willing to accept help (such as friends/family helping with errands) and been willing to have a social life I was not involved in. Especially if he had sought out other partners that also had a caregiving burden. \n\nYou both need to look at this long-term. Because it is likely that you will experience more fatigue and increasing disability as you get older and your joints wear down. Not to mention the fact that the most common causes of death for RA patients are rheumatoid lung and cardiac issues related to the RA, which means you could also be dealing with trying to manage other illnesses in the future.\n\nYou deserve someone who wants to be there for you and is *able* to be there for you. \n\n**I'm not saying break up, but I am saying that this is the kind of issue in your relationship that you can't ignore or you *will* break up and/or bitterly resent each other.**\n\n\n**Edit:** I should also add that *he also deserves to have his needs met. It's unfair to both of you if you two don't address this.* \n\nAlso, I know you're overwhelmed right now, but when you are back on meds and feeling more functional, it may be time to research your RA more thoroughly. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, but I was a little surprised you said your RA was diagnosed at 14 and that your mom had it, but you didn't know fatigue was a major part of RA. It's often one of the first things you learn researching it. I'm assuming that your mom's own familiarity and your young age at diagnosis may be why the hardcore research mode wasn't part of your process. **This is totally understandable**, but there is a lot of information you need to know that may have fallen through the cracks as a result.",1650343427,t3_u6qw65,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u6qw65/is_this_really_ra_related/i5aysko/

They (very slowly) have started to understand some things about my condition a bit better.\n\nAnother thing that could help your partner to feel heard is speaking with your doctor more about the fatigue. Give them all the details of how much you're sleeping to recover and how you feel. See if there are other treatment options available to help alleviate the fatigue. For me, when the fatigue is that bad, my doctor and I start to consider different medication options etc. If your partner sees that you are doing everything you can with your doctors to fix it, and still feeling this way, maybe he would see the truth. \n\nI really hope your partner will come to understand you better.

When I was in my 20s I had a short bout of ""depression"". I would have denied it up and down. I'm NOT depressed. etc. In hindsight, I see that I was displaying symptoms. For me, the more I sept, the more I wanted to sleep. The more tired I was. The more impossible it was to wake up and feel awake a fresh. The more naps I took, the more I slept, the harder it was not to sleep. I almost become addicted in way because I would wake up and the first thing I would do is plan when I could nap. Sometimes I called in sick to work because I was just too tired. I could sleep 15 hours or more a day if left to my own devices.\n\n...you also mentioned a lack of sex drive. For one, you are a woman and women have fluctuating sex drives over their life but also.... lack of sex drive is a symptom of depression.\n\nIf you have the mobility: when you feel yourself getting drowsy do 10-15 squats.

i594jlr,u6htm3,"Tell your Mum to listen to her doctors, they are the best people to advise. The unavoidable thing about RA is that it is a destructive, painful and progressive illness that needs proper treatment with medication or else it will slowly erode joints and affect organs, causing irreversible damage and disability. \n\nWhile the meds might seem scary, they are the only way to slow the progression of the illness. They will not stop it nor cure it, but they will ease her pain and prevent disability from happening too quickly. She will still have pain and flares and maybe mobility issues too, but it will be far better than going unmedicated. \n\nIf you look through this sub, you will find many people asking about going unmedicated for RA, and the responses are almost always the same: it‚Äôs not worth it. There are people in this sub who have permanent disabilities and damage because of choosing to be unmedicated, and I‚Äôve seen several people express regret. \n\nI‚Äôve been treated for RA for 9 years now, and while I was afraid of the immunosuppressants at first, I do not regret them in the slightest. My pain was unbearable before I started them and they have made my life so much better. I still have problems with pain, but that‚Äôs sadly just the nature of this illness.

i59hk90,u6htm3,"Yes, it can sound scary, but it‚Äôs not as bad as it can seem. \n\nFirstly, it‚Äôs important to understand that these medications don‚Äôt relieve pain, they do something more important, which is that they slow down the progression of the disease. Without these medications, RA will damage the joints and organs irreversibly, much faster. It can lead to early disability and issues with the eyes, heart and lungs to name just a few of the potential problems. Google the disabilities that RA causes, it is not good, and in the past people generally ended up in a wheelchair or unable to use their hands. These drugs help with pain by stopping the immune system from attacking the body, they don‚Äôt actually work as pain relief. There are no other medications or treatment that will do this. Some things can help ease symptoms or relieve pain, but they will not stop the progression of the disease. \n\nIn terms of covid, it‚Äôs important to know that while we do have suppressed immune systems, research has so far suggested that RA patients don‚Äôt really have a much higher risk of severe illness or death, and it does not increase our chances of getting covid or hospitalisation if we do get covid. So, while we do have to be careful, it‚Äôs really just because we have to be careful with any infection. What I have been told is that you are more at risk with covid if you have untreated RA that is actively affecting your immune system and health. \n\nThe immunosuppression is not extreme. It will generally just mean that you might have a harder time recovering from a cold or that you pick up bugs a bit more easily. It will also mean that you have to be aware of your medications around things like surgery, where you need your immune system to work a bit more strongly, but doctors generally help to manage this. In my nearly 10 years of dealing with RA; I have really not had much of an issue with this at all. There are things you can do to improve your immune health such as eating well, managing stress, getting good sleep, taking multivitamins, eating fermented foods, getting exercise and remembering to wash your hands where possible or carry hand sanitizer. It is best to avoid close contact with other sick people where possible, but there are many people working in healthcare while taking these types of medications and they do just fine. \n\nSo for a lot of RA patients, the benefits of the medications outweigh the negatives. I would never go back to the amount of pain that I experienced before treatment, my life was awful. I also really don‚Äôt want to experience disability any more than I already have - I have one wrist that is fused, and I‚Äôd rather keep it at just the one, it‚Äôs painful and difficult enough without having more issues. I also worry about having vision problems or scarring on my lungs, or me heart being affected by RA - to me, this is scarier than taking some extra time to fight off a cold!",1650319137,t1_i59ef0w,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u6htm3/for_those_who_have_been_fighting_ra_for_a_while/i59hk90/
i59h7jo,u6htm3,"Don't forget that it's not just about pain relief. Your immune system is eating away at your joints so HAS to be suppressed. The earlier the better. I've had 8 months so far trying to find the right meds knowing that all that time the damage continues.   \nFinally getting some traction with a biologic (which is based on a naturally produced antibody but still might have side effects for some people. )  \nMaybe ask if you'd have the same trust in 'natural' treatments for some of those really scary illnesses.   \nBut absolutely read as much as you can about how managing activity, diet, sleep and stress can help.   \nI notice that for many there's a massive fear of side effects. Maybe that's a cultural thing because hereabouts the discussion goes along the lines of ""We'll try this one because it has had the most widespread results but it may not work for you as an individual.

i5b3xwh,u6hs26,"You've already had some good responses, but I have some things to add:\n\nVery padded armchairs/couches with very high backs became my best friend. I dunno about others, but for me, I've found that *pulling* on my wrists to help my motion is FAR less painful and tiring than *pushing* against my wrists. High backed chairs have allowed me to be on top for much longer than I could be otherwise. The cushion helps the knees, but also shifts your center of balance on your knees, which I generally found to be easier.\n\nI also got into rope play. Being tied properly to something in some way would often allow me to use the stability and support offered to push off of, or just to hold positions I couldn't usually hold. Actually, there is quite a lot of BDSM-related equipment that is incredibly disability friendly and customizable. \n\nSturdy counters and tables are your new sexiest friend. Being bent over them is much less stress on a lot of joints, but also sitting on them with your legs wrapped around him, or a couple chairs to rest your feet on can be a great support and easier on both of you. \n\nI've heard good things about the IntimateRider chair/cushion set, but that's above my budget. Might be worth the money though as it's supposedly designed to help with the necessary movement while minimizing the effort required. \n\nOne of the big things that also helped me was resistance training and exercises that stretch your muscles and focus on endurance - such as Tai Chi. Obviously, it's more of a long term thing, but one of the biggest things that can help is strengthening and stretching your muscles. You do have to have a lot of patience and sense about it though. It will tire you out more in the short term and it will take you longer than an able-bodied person to build up your strength and endurance, because you have to pace yourself more.",1650346638,t3_u6hs26,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u6hs26/any_resources_or_toy_recommendations_for_ra/i5b3xwh/

i5j9xc7,u6dkph,"Sorry to hear about that.\n\nIf it can be of any help, consider that lung toxicity is being heavily reviewed: lung involvement in RA is a thing, and it's being more under the scope in recent years, thus the old association ""high MTX doses - interstitial lung disease"" is considerered (by me also) more like ""high MTX doses for more aggressive RA - more likelyhood of RA lung involvement"". The only proven effect is lung focal infiltrates, representing a type IV adverse reaction and presenting early in the therapy course. No effect on lung nodules, if not beneficial as for better disease control.\n\nMoral is, if your disease is well under control with your therapy, go on. If not, consider MTX: it's the gold standard drug, and for a reason, and when in association with a biologic drug the effect is greater than the sum of the parts, both for efficacy and for likelyhood of persistence of it (ie less anti-drug antibodies)",1650490103,t1_i5iuxla,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u6dkph/been_diagnosed_with_ra_and_prescribed/i5j9xc7/

i55q67t,u5vcfz,I'd stick to the recommended Folic acid or ask for your dosages to be slightly increased (from Ireland not sure of you can do that in America) Folic acid is great for helping your liver fight of the bad things in methotrexate. But to much folic acid may reduce the effectiveness of your methotrexate. And therefore reduce your treatment.,1650247434,t3_u5vcfz,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5vcfz/folic_acid_vs_rheumate/i55q67t/
i55gcex,u5vcfz,My insurance wouldnt approve it but i do take folate.  Some people dont absorb folic acid very well so folate allows you to absorb it better.  Rheumate is just folate and Vitamin B and maybe something else.  But definitely worth asking your doc about it.

I started on 5mg per week but suffered from terrible mouth ulcers - do you get those?\n\nI reckon you feeling better is because of your nap. Do you usually nap the day following your dose? I find the best thing for me to reduce the methotrexate fatigue is having a long sleep (12 hours or more) but even then I often feel tired again in the afternoon which a nap usually fixes. It's just a shame I lose a day out of my weekend each week.,1650279865,t3_u5vcfz,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5vcfz/folic_acid_vs_rheumate/i570myj/

Everyone thought it was growing pains or basketball injuries (I was 10). It's only been after years of debilitating pain and inconsistent treatment due to insurance issues that I have gone from somewhat overweight to obese by the BMI scale. \n\nEven so, until the last couple of years (I'm mid 30's now) I kept my BMI between 23-27. It's only as the joint damage has become worse and I've had less control over my food due to relying on the family as caregivers, that I have tipped over 30 on the BMI charts. \n\nI've bounced up and down in weight a lot over the years though. Usually shedding pounds in the spring/summer and gaining in fall/winter when my symptoms are worse. Yes, losing weight helps the pain to a certain extent, but it certainly doesn't work miracles. I didn't notice much of a difference when I was younger, but now, with more joint damage, it's easier to tell the difference.

i52ihce,u5h6jx,"Honestly, while remission is the goal, it is probably not a realistic one for most people. Remission *generally* means your blood tests show very low inflammation levels and there is little to no joint pain, swelling or stiffness. People in remission feel normal, or almost normal. \n\n*Because the definition of remission has been very subjective for so long, it's difficult to say what the odds are.* The problem is that there hasn't been much of an attempt to standardize what that means, so the ""remission"" rate is anywhere from 10-60% depending on what parameters are being used to judge. Even if you go with the most optimistic 60% though, from what I've read over the years, a huge chunk of those people bounce between remission and relapses. \n\n**A big factor in this is how well treatments work, how fast they work, and if your friend is able to stay on medications consistently.** Personally, after 20+ years of RA and fighting insurance to say on medications (which can take months/years), cycling through medications because something stopped working, flat out not having insurance for many years, and being told I have treatment-resistant RA, I'm in rough shape. I'm bedridden for much of the year and have very little social life outside of the internet. I have maybe 3-5 good months out of the year, depending on the weather. I had to adapt to isolation long before COVID. I can't keep a job, because often I flare so badly I can't even think for days or weeks. Often, I can't even escape the blankets on my bed by myself. \n\n**That doesn't mean your friend will end up as bad as that. It took a long time for me to get to this point. However, it is important to note that there is a fine balance between encouraging and toxic positivity. Because it's entirely possible this is her future and she will need to find new ways to do everything - including handle friendships and create joy. Manage your own expectations - you may need to adapt if you value your friendship** To this day, I have friends and family that refuse to accept that even if I get on a great new medication tomorrow, there is so much joint damage I will always be disabled. Then they wonder why I don't want to spend time with them, but their refusal to accept my reality is just depressing for me and sends me into a tailspin, so I've had to distance myself from many people.\n\n**Yet, on the flip side, I know someone whose treatment worked so well, she went right back into competitive sports. You're looking for a baseline of the new normal, but there just isn't a good answer to that. I have RA in literally every joint in my body. I know other people who have RA but only a few joints are affected** \n\n**The goal** is a relatively normal life where they can support themselves, cook for themselves, etc. However, I know very few people with RA who really can do that long-term. Many of us have to rely heavily on family and friends day-to-day, as well as assistive devices. Because even with medication controlling it moderately well, the joint damage is likely to continue. Slower, but still. \n\n**As far as a timeline?** Most medications I've been on have taken 3-6 months to start showing improvement. (Prednisone is an outlier in that regard.) However, it can take longer to get to full effectiveness. This too depends on the medication they are on, so it's hard to give you a ballpark here. Especially as it is likely they will need to try some different combinations to see what works best.\n\n*Yes, even though your friend isn't on immunosuppressants yet, they need to stay away from sick people.* When your immune system is in overdrive 24/7 trying to fight off an illness, adding even the common cold or flu into that mix can be a problem. There really is just only so much your immune system can handle at once and right now, her immune system thinks it's in the middle of an all-out war. It'll be a bigger problem on immunosuppressants, but it's still a problem. Especially as time goes on and the body becomes more worn down. \n\n**But it does feel like you're looking for some predictability with RA that simply isn't there, despite your disclaimers. This is human and totally understandable, but unrealistic for many of us.** There are things like bad weather or over-exertion or being sick, or stress that will cause flares, but often, there will just be flares for no reason that anyone can pinpoint. *Heck, sometimes all the factors for a flare will be there and I somehow escape relatively unscathed*. That's just how it is. \n\nWhile it's important for your friend to try and track those patterns, especially while figuring out medications - there can be a point where that's no longer helpful, but just a really effective way to drive herself crazy. It's really hard to give advice without really knowing where she is in the whole process. \n\n***As hard as it is to watch, there is only so much you can do. Because ultimately, even those of us with the same disease have wildly different symptoms and develop (or don't develop) comorbidities.*** \n\n**The best thing you can do is probably to encourage them to get involved in Chronic Pain and Rheumatoid support groups. If they won't do it themselves, (they may not be ready to admit they need community) linger around these spaces yourself. Read the experiences.** Let your friend know that they aren't crazy or weak. Give them space to grieve. Pick up tricks to pass on (not medical advice, but things like clothes that are easier to get on, or tricks for opening bottles if her hands are weak) and show her in small ways there is value in reaching out to these communities. If you're able, offer to help them with physical therapy (the doctor will likely suggest a physical therapist once the inflammation is under enough control to start) or rides to the appointments/store/whatever.\n\nUltimately, she is likely to dismiss a lot of your help because you can't feel what she's feeling and understand exactly what she's going through. All you can do is try to be there for her and try to validate and normalize her life as it is now.\n\n**I realize this wall of text sounds very negative. I don't mean it to be. You're a VERY good friend for trying to encourage her and understand her situation.** Ultimately, what I'm trying to drive home is - your friend really is going to have to figure out a lot of this for herself. No one else can judge what too much or too little activity/medication/whatever is for her. It's really just a hell of a lot of trial and error. **You run the risk of becoming a person whose very presence makes her feel guilty for not being *fixed, which could easily result in her feeling too overwhelmed to continue the friendship if you push it.** All you can do is be there and try to keep your friend from being isolated. \n\n*You'd be amazed at how hard someone will push themselves for the person who doesn't push them but accepts them without question.*",1650194239,t3_u5h6jx,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5h6jx/what_is_the_best_to_hope_for_wrt_treatment_and/i52ihce/

i52mt7o,u5h6jx,"Something that has helped me is a mindset shift. Not comparing myself to who I was or what I was capable of before my diagnosis. Instead now, focusing on who I am at present and what I can do. I also learned this in a group therapy setting with others who were struggling with a lot of different kinds of chronic illness. One woman put it very nicely: She had to let go of the version of herself who enjoyed morning and evening jogs. Now she is a lover of poetry and craft beers. She is a Jazz connoisseur and an explorer of vintage record shops. She has a very full life, it is just very different than the one she led previously. I also highly recommend the book, ""How to Live Well with Chronic Pain and Illness"" by Toni Bernhard. It focuses on mindfulness, how to say no and educating family and friends about chronic illness. You are a good friend for supporting them. It may take more time, years even, for them to shift their mindset. For me, it took individual and group therapy, mindfulness training, reading that book and letting go of my anxiety of the future (what ifs...?!) And truly being present, living in the now and appreciating the good days and my body for what it could do now. Thankfully, I am on a biologic (Kineret) that has transformed my life.

There are some out there through various organizations. I‚Äôve also seen a few books about how to approach a relationship with someone who has been diagnosed with a chronic illness. \n\nBut I think it boils down to listening.

i548apy,u5h6jx,"Thank you for your honest answer! I appreciate your input. I‚Äôll try to come back to this and process it more deeply over time in chunks. \n\nI definitely am aware of the harm of toxic positivity. I‚Äôm literally at the tail end of a 2+ year process of grappling with federal disability support in my own life. My friend and I have very different conditions (they are non-binary and use they/them pronouns btw!), but we share an understanding of both what it feels like to live with variable symptom severity, a feeling of betrayal from our own body, a memory of ‚Äúbefore,‚Äù and the harsh realities of now. We‚Äôre a big part of each other‚Äôs support network. I definitely am a proponent of living as well as possible rather than ‚Äúrecovering.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs a nuance a lot of people just can‚Äôt understand. \n\nI think the thing that‚Äôs so painful here is embracing ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt.‚Äù Doing that has been helpful for me in the long run. Knowing what I can‚Äôt do means finding what I can instead of hurting myself over and over. \n\nI know it takes time and I have no plan to rush them. But empathetic encouragement is something I‚Äôm desperate to provide in between the times that I just need to be there to hold them or make them dinner. I find that they keep pushing themself for me, trying to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when I‚Äôve never demanded it. Things like not telling me their knees are dying until I ask prompting questions like ‚Äúwould you rather go home to sit together or go out to do x?‚Äù I think they‚Äôre more afraid of losing me than there is actual risk of it, and that breaks my heart. They‚Äôve literally come over and sat with me through my physically involuntary screaming fits. I hate that after even that they‚Äôre afraid I‚Äôll judge them for needing to lie down with their wedge and just hang out quietly instead of going shopping or whatever. I wish they believed in their worth as much as I do, you know? They‚Äôve wound up in grateful tears after I‚Äôve pulled an admission of ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù out of them and we‚Äôve carried on to have a good evening doing nothing together. I love them so much and I want them to be safe and happy. But I think there are so many fears and anxieties inside them, both from present day and long gone traumas, that they hit a crisis and wind up so terrified of being alone that they resort to acting. There‚Äôs an unfortunate history there. :( \n\nI‚Äôm not looking for predictability or a promise of stability as much as I am looking for a realistic future outlook. I know I can navigate my friend‚Äôs emotional state/needs better than strangers online can, especially when I give my interpersonal explanations through an autistic lens. We‚Äôve been through a lot together at this point. But knowing where the realistic guideposts are means that when they need that realism, I have it on hand. They‚Äôre not as broadly connected online as I am and so finding a community like this one, much less keeping tabs on it, isn‚Äôt going to come naturally. I want to do the emotional labor of parsing all this information because it‚Äôs less traumatic for me to process since I‚Äôm a step removed. Then when they say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to hope for‚Äù I can offer a realistic perspective rather than saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù \n\nRealism doesn‚Äôt mean certainty, by any means. In my own circumstances, it means moderation, self regulation, and a gratitude for the good days. It means sometimes things will hurt or be very scary to experience. It means knowing my limits and capabilities. Knowing that ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù aren‚Äôt guarantees. And it means knowing how to stand up for myself. But all of that is only vaguely alluding to the functional realities of my situation, you know? They probably apply here, too. But the specifics? What those ranges mean or how they could or could not manifest? I have no idea. Conditions have typical and atypical trajectories, popular medical myths that saturate public narratives, and often an intrinsic obfuscation to people who don‚Äôt know the lingo already. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm lurking here to begin with. I want to know more what it REALLY means to have RA rather than to read some article written by a medically minded weirdo with completely deadened empathy. \n\n‚Ä¶ sorry this is so long. I am trying to respond as thoroughly and honestly as you did. Thank you for your patience with me. \n\nI‚Äôve definitely been trying to learn tips and tricks and understand accessibility tools better! I want to be able to casually give advice when they ask for it or lament something with a potential solution. They‚Äôve JUST made an appointment with a PT this last week, so that will be happening soon. Despite not having a rheumy, their GP is very familiar with autoimmune conditions. It‚Äôs been an extreme relief to have her on my friend‚Äôs medical team. She BELIEVES them. \n\nI‚Äôll try to poke around for support groups. Having that info on-hand could be useful when they need to connect with people who they don‚Äôt have to explain things to. I know the lack of connection for my own condition is a constant heartbreak. So having that option available once they‚Äôre ready for it is a really good idea. \n\nI also appreciate the explanation regarding illnesses. They‚Äôll likely have to navigate that mostly on their own, but it means I can be a better friend if I happen to catch the sniffles myself. Thank you for teaching me. \n\nAgain, thank you for your thorough and empathetic response. I really want to be as good as friend as I can be, whether it‚Äôs this or any other unexpected issue. Love is an action and a choice. Love is work. But a good relationship, platonic or otherwise, means that work is natural and easy. Every chance to be kind is an opportunity rather than an obligation. I want to rise to meet that opportunity as well as I possibly can, and as well as they deserve.",1650223333,t1_i52ihce,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5h6jx/what_is_the_best_to_hope_for_wrt_treatment_and/i548apy/

That sounds trite when I type it out but I‚Äôm being sincere. \n\nI think they‚Äôre still in the stage where they can‚Äôt accept it won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôve had a very long time to come to terms with my own diagnoses, and I am consciously trying to avoid pushing my friend to fast-track through the grieving process necessary for something like this. Variable and inconsistent conditions I think are especially traumatic because you feel that hope over and over, a fleeting glimpse of an old definition of normal, and then it‚Äôs gone again. That hits every single time. I think it‚Äôs very normal to feel anger and sadness and grief and even to be mad at people who don‚Äôt have to experience it. I know for me it feels like people don‚Äôt know their own freedom. It‚Äôs wasted on them. I imagine it can feel the same for other conditions, as well. \n\nI think the thing I want most of all for my friend is for them to know things don‚Äôt have to be good or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù for them to be happy. And they don‚Äôt have to be how they were before to be worthy of love and care. They don‚Äôt have to be how they were before to be a good friend, either. They‚Äôre who they are and who they are is ok. It makes me really sad to see them hurt themself over and over trying to be something they aren‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt need to hurt themself extra to be lovable. I want to help them find their new happy just as much as I want to help them grieve their new pain scale. I love them so much. They‚Äôre very important to me.\n\nThank you for letting me know your timeframe. I want to understand what the full spectrum of experiences can look like. I am sorry that you have to feel so adrift even after so many years. I wish everyone had clear answers and could stop hurting. Again, that feels very trite to say. I hope it isn‚Äôt patronizing. Maybe it‚Äôs childish to wish nobody had to hurt but I don‚Äôt think I can stop wishing even if I can stop hoping. I do hope you can be treated with the kindness and understanding you deserve while going through such tumultuous and painful experiences.

i548yuo,u5h6jx,"Yes, I DEFINITELY resonate with this! I‚Äôve been collecting more and more letters in my alphabet soup of diagnoses my whole life.

It‚Äôs a loss that is hard to explain to people who think ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù is an option. While I obviously can‚Äôt personally understand RA, that aspect of chronic diagnoses and disability is something I am intimately familiar with. It is always going to take time and in my own experience it seems like it never fully goes away. The grief hits again at unexpected times, in waves. \n\nThe book is an excellent recommendation.

Thank you so much. \n\nI think I definitely do need to be careful about trying too hard to hold their hand through more of it than I‚Äôm actually equipped to. They are falling back into old habits they used to have when we first met, where they say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to everything and hide what they need. I think they‚Äôre struggling with some level of overlap between ‚ÄúI just wish things could go back to how they were‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a bother and get left behind.‚Äù I have no intention of leaving them behind at all!

i5be7qw,u5h6jx,"It sounds like you are the perfect friend to help them through this. I definitely didn't understand the difference between ""recovering"" and ""living well"" even 5-10 years into my diagnosis. You're smarter than I am! They may not be able to hear it yet, but when they are ready, I think hearing your perspective and watching you live that philosophy will help immensely. \n\nI completely understand why embracing ""I can't"" is difficult. We want to save our loved ones from the struggles we have gone through, but unfortunately, I don't think there is a shortcut there. They just have to go through that hurt over and over again to *know* that their current coping mechanisms are not sustainable and get over some of that internalized ableism that makes us sabotage ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately, that fear of abandonment that drives them to push themselves is heartbreaking, but absolutely something you can do something about, by being exactly who you are. A supportive friend who understands the struggle and cares enough to be proactive about your support. It sounds like you're doing everything you can - it just takes time. You know this already, I'm sure, but it doesn't make it any easier on you. \n\nThe fact that you are the kind of friend who knows how important it is to be checking in and making sure that they know plans are flexible, or that you may need to go home early shows you're way ahead of the game. \n\nAgain, they may not be ready to hear it, but when you think they are - you may want to point out that they have helped you through your own struggles with illness and pain. They will probably try to say it wasn't a big deal. Turn it around on them. It's not a big deal because it feels good to be able to help a friend. **They are willing to help, but unwilling to give the *gift* that is allowing you to help them**. To feel the joy of being able to help alleviate their suffering. To feel the warmth of their trust in you.\n\nAs a person who struggles with accepting help myself, someone once said this to me - that it was a *gift* to help a friend and it did change my perspective. I still struggle with dropping the mask and accepting help due to my own traumas, but it helps a lot to reframe it in a way that reminds me how much I like to be that person for other people. I think this is something you also have a very good grasp of, judging by your response but perhaps they have not considered it, or at least, not in a way that hits home, emotionally yet. \n\nIf they are anything like me, you may still have to hit them over the head and tell them to stop being dumb about it. To keep checking in just as you're doing now, even years down the line. Sometimes for me, it's not that I don't know I can trust that person, or that I'm not loved and supported. It's that hiding my pain is such an ingrained instinct that my brain doesn't even have the bandwidth to process that I don't *have to* with this person. Sometimes I don't recognize I'm even doing it until I'm suffering later.\n\nI definitely wasn't trying to say that as an internet stranger, I can judge what your friend is ready to hear or deal with not. Obviously, as their friend, you have a much better handle on that. I do apologize if it sounded like I was implying that, (and for misgendering them) I'm afraid I've been a little sleep-deprived and so I ramble, but have been coming across more bluntly/negatively or more lecture slanted than intended in the last week or so. \n\nProbably one of the important things to really drill home is that there are better and worse outcomes - but while they will likely always deal with some pain and fatigue, you get used to certain levels of pain and fatigue. They can adapt, even if it doesn't look like what they want it to look like. \n\nMany people work, go to school, have relationships, children, social activities and volunteer on top of it. It just depends heavily on finding the right medications, physical therapy, mental health resources, and learning to alter coping mechanisms and know when to say no to the demands people make on their energy and time. You already have experience with a lot of those things, even if you don't fully have a handle on them yourself yet. That will help your friend immensely and I'm so glad that they have also been there as your support through your own struggles. That's such a rare gift to have a ride-or-die friend like that. \n\nThey do have hope though. Even though I may not have explained that in my last post. Until I had insurance issues, I was doing everything on that above list, with the exception of dealing with children. I'd go on tons of hikes on weekends. I volunteered 1-3 times a week. I'd walk 2-5 miles a day, plus other physical therapy because keeping the joints moving is important for ability. \n\nAt my best, I still couldn't keep a full-time job, and even a part-time job fatigued me so much that I couldn't do much. However, I was running my own amazon business from home and had some other side hustles. It's not that I couldn't work. It's that I had to find a way to work at my own pace. Sometimes that meant 2 days of intense activity and very little activity 5 days out of the week. Sometimes that meant a day on, a day off. Sometimes it was just 20 minutes here or there. Sometimes it was hours straight. The flexibility, I discovered, was the key to working. \n\nNo matter how well they do day-to-day though, there are always gonna be bad flares that ruin plans. Hope for the best, plan for the worst is gonna have to be a part of their new philosophy or they'll go crazy.\n\nInsurance issues and a lack of treatment caught up to me and my world is much smaller now. I can't work, but it took more than 15 years of inconsistent treatment to get to this point and by now I've figured out a lot of low key activities that give me joy and ""cripple tricks"" (as I like to call them) that make life easier. \n\nAlso, I would say that you don't need to thank me for being patient. No patience was required. I'm happy to help. Also, as someone whose biggest support for a decade was also on the spectrum, I think people often undervalue the different perspectives to be gained from the autistic community. Just as people undervalue the perspective to be gained from the chronically ill community.\n\nMy apologies for once again, sending you a huge wall of text to work through! Please don't apologize for your own length, but don't feel pressured to match my response. You have your own energy to conserve! That being said, you are always welcome to DM me if you want to discuss anything, or if your friend needs to discuss anything. \n\nMine is certainly not the only perspective on life with RA, but I'm willing to help in whatever way I can.",1650354502,t1_i548apy,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5h6jx/what_is_the_best_to_hope_for_wrt_treatment_and/i5be7qw/

i536y6l,u5h6jx,"I am currently in remission (with meds).  I have been in remission for about a year and a half.

For example, last summer I did a day long strenuous hike and I was pretty achy and had a swollen knee by the end (15+ miles).  I recovered within a day though and it was worth it.  I can do all my normal life activities and workouts without flaring.  Sometimes I‚Äôm a little more tired than I would have been before RA, and sometimes a little achy first thing when I wake up, but it goes away pretty quickly.\n\nSince being in remission, I have had a couple very mild flares that were a couple days in length, but they were more like breakthrough pain than what a flare felt like before my current medication combo.  \n\nThis big BUT to all of this wonderful remission is that I don‚Äôt expect to be in remission forever.

i5180fe,u5b0cd,You aren‚Äôt in remission if you have symptoms.  Remission is basically feeling like you‚Äôre back to normal (unless you have permanent damage that is causing pain).  \n\nI‚Äôm sorry you are going through all of this after the stress of your cancer diagnosis.  Is it possible to reach out to your former rheumatologists office and ask if they can speak to your new care team?  It could also be worth starting the plaquenil to see if it helps and asking the new rheum what the plan is if it doesn‚Äôt.  I mean it would be awesome if the plaquenil alone helped and you didn‚Äôt end up needing a biologic after all.  Weirder things have happened.  In the meantime that would give you time to ask around for another rheum if you need to go that way.  I highly suggest seeking out a teaching hospital that has a rheum fellows clinic - I am sure you would be an interesting learning case (I mean that not in a bad way) as someone who is post cancer and has been given the run around.\n\nGood luck friend <3,1650161726,t3_u5b0cd,/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5b0cd/cured/i5180fe/

I denied having dry eyes and dry mouth in my first visit. I was there for pain. then when I went back for a follow up she told me she wanted to put me on plaquenil because I was a ""young woman of childbearing age"" and I could take it while pregnant. I've never wanted kids and she didn't even ask me if I did. and that was like her top priority, not whether or not it would help my pain.\n\nsecond rheum was good at first, though I will admit that in over 2 years of being a patient of the practice I only met the doctor once just a few months ago. other than that I've always seen his PA. his PA was nice and listened to me though, so I decided to stay. was all good until a little over a month ago when I had a reaction to my second orencia infusion. my stomach hurt, it was becoming harder and harder to breathe, and I was lightheaded. he brushed it off and said it was a panic attack because I didn't have a rash. except I have no history of panic attacks and I wasnt even anxious. he also wasn't wearing a mask, nor was his infusion nurse. in their office of immunocompromised patients. and the infusion center was advertising something called ""skinny shots"" in the bathroom. super weird experience.\n\nthen I saw a third rheum, who told me that she had no idea why any the other two were treating me for anything, and that I shouldn't be on unnecessary meds compromising my immune system because she didnt think I had any inflammatory disease. she said my pain was probably just from overuse and my fatigue was probably just from poor sleep hygiene.\n\nI'm still seeing rheum #2, but I have appointments with 3 others over the next few months and I'm just going to see what happens. this is something you will deal with long-term, and you need someone in your corner that's gonna listen to you and that you feel comfortable with. if you're worried about it reflecting badly on you, you don't have to disclose how many rheums you've seen before.

i52tf7s,u4mwo1,"Yeah. I think some of it is unavoidable, but it is important to do your research on your massage therapist as well. For example, my state is one of the hardest states to get licensed in because they require a lot more medical training. This means I can often find someone with education/experience with RA. Some states don't require very much to get licensed and unfortunately, many states allow those licenses to transfer, regardless of whether or not that person has met the educational requirements in the tougher state.\n\nHowever, as my last massage therapist (a close friend) once told me - vet your therapist carefully. Some businesses (especially the cheaper ones) encourage people to purposely massage you a tad unevenly, so you immediately feel better, but feel worse over the following weeks and come back sooner.\n\nWhich is my long-winded way of saying - do your research for your area. Even if you're outside of the US, there may be similar issues. Try to find someone familiar with RA, as they can often change their technique to minimize your flares. I still have mini flares either way, but they are definitely better with someone who knows what they are doing. Don't take your MT's word on it.

i4kflit,u2gdk1,"Hi, also seronegative and it took me over 10 years to get diagnosed bc my former docs never thought to look for anything other than seropositivity. In that time I‚Äôve developed bursitis in my knees, ankles, wrists/hands, and right bicep tendon/rotator cuff. If you‚Äôre showing symptoms, the damage is happening‚Äîit just means it‚Äôs a variant on the condition that doesn‚Äôt fit the originally strictly-classified definitions. Whether or not you ever develop seropositivity, it will be there.\n\nAnother big thing that I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned is the internal damage that can be done. RA attacks your muscles and soft tissue, so unmedicated we‚Äôre far more likely to develop damage to our heart and lungs (which can stay hidden for a long time). Even if you don‚Äôt feel it, it‚Äôs causing damage. The only way to fully mitigate the effects of RA is to treat it with medications. \n\nIf it helps, look up Psoriatic Arthritis‚Äîalmost no one with PsA is seropositive but there‚Äôs still remarkable damage that can be done. PsA is an inflammatory arthritis like RA and is caused by the same factors; most medications will treat either one, and since I‚Äôm seronegative with psoriasis I‚Äôve been diagnosed interchangeably between the two.\n\nAlso, if it helps your anxiety, these meds have been around for a long time. Doctors are well aware of the risk/benefit ratio, and if you have been prescribed a medication it means your doctor thinks it will help you. MTX wasn‚Äôt the answer for me as it triggered my migraines and gave me terrible nausea, but it‚Äôs a great treatment for many people. Just keep up with your bloodwork so your doctor can keep an eye on your liver and you should be good. Far more dangerous than MTX is NSAIDs, which many of us use long-term to manage the inflammation and pain. I‚Äôve developed GERD from long-term use of a very strong prescription NSAID (etodolac) and now I get to take Prilosec twice a day forever. Make sure you‚Äôre eating full meals with any NSAID you take so you don‚Äôt end up in my shoes.\n\n(Sorry this ended up really long‚Äîmy mother has a tendency to believe a lot of conspiracies about things like meds or vaccines until it‚Äôs explained to her so I‚Äôve both spent a lot of time refining these arguments and gotten a bit sensitized to them as she always asks me when I can start going off my meds, like this is a condition that will go away.

Statistically, it was very likely an infection he's just had and the other stuff is being caused by allergies, etc. The doctor most likely referred ur son to a rheumatologist to cover the basis ""just in case"" b/c there is documented inflammation in blood work.\n\n1. Being thirsty could very likely be a result of his allergies, possibly breathing through his mouth due to stuffy nose.\n\n2. The snoring & stopping breathing is most likely harmless. Could be allergies or sleep apnea, etc.\n\n3. The sweating could be b/c he is too hot. Could also be b/c he drinks a lot due to dry mouth & it's his body's way of getting rid of excess fluid. (Gum is great for dry mouth but idk about giving it to an almost 4 y/o).\n\n4. His head & legs hurt when he was sick likely b/c of the fever & being sick in general.\n\n4. The blood work: the most likely explanation is he's had some kind of infection. Yes, it could also be rheumatic BUT statistically the chances are much higher that it's just an infection. There are a gazillion pathogens it could be that they didn't test for.\n\n\nHere is what I would do:\n\nA. Look for any kind of redness, swelling, rash, break outs and abnormalities on skin on a daily basis. Take pictures if you find something so u can show it later to the doctors.\n\nB. Diet is vital. Organic, whole foods are best. If u can grow a garden & involve ur son in doing things in it with u, that would be very healthy for him. I'm educated in biomed & used to think the whole organic/nature/gardening stuff was just hippie talk but my God was I wrong to think that! I've seen incredible results with it. I know not everyone can afford super dooper organic foods, nor have the energy/time for gardening, etc. But if it's something u are capable of doing, that would be very good. \n\nC. Let him play outside (weather, etc. permitting) as much as possible.\n\nD. If u have not taken him to an allergist, I'd recommend it. They can test for possible triggers & recommend solutions/treatments.\n\nE. Don't spray ur lawn with any herbacides/insecticides for pests/weeds. Don't spray for ants.

i3puyz3,txuo9m,"Traditional RA generally starts in the small joints (fingers, wrist, etc.).  Your symptoms do not present as typical RA.\n\nPresumably you have been tested for RA via a blood draw: CRP, RF Factor, 13-3-3 Eta protein and those are negative (otherwise you would know you have RA and would be on a DMAED protocol).\n\nThere are a few other conditions that can manifest with your symptoms.  I'm not a doctor and would encourage you to always use physicians to make health decisions, but you could test for the following:\n\n1) Gout.  A uric acid blood test is less than $30 without insurance.  Gout can drive arthritis, and the ankle joint is a typical affected joint.\n\n2) Psuedogout (which is like gout, only instead of uric acid a type of calcium is deposited in your joint tissue).\n\n3) Lupus.  Lupus is an autoimmune disease like RA, but is broader (it affects other organs, but doesn't focus in on joints in the same way RA does).  A rheumatological blood panel can test for markers.  This can also cover RA markers at the same time.  You will need a rheumatologist Rx for the test.\n\n4) Reactive Arthritis.  A virus, vaccine, or other offending agent can drive arthritis.  Going on a strict anti-inflammatory diet (think whole-food, vegan for a month) to see if there is improvement can help.\n\n5) Psoriatic Arthritis.  Typically this would manifest with dry and/or irritated skin too, which you don't seem to have, so probably not PA, but worth keeping on a list until it is struck off.\n\n6) Paraneoplastic Arthritis.  Sometimes peoples heightened immune system when fighting cancer can trigger arthritis.  You should be mindful of other symptoms like fatigue and weight loss.  Your age makes this improbable, but worth keeping on a list until it is struck off.\n\n\nMy internet diagnosis:\n\n- Probably not RA.  I am assuming you are a male (net many female programmers).  RA disproportionately affects females and is generally diagnosed in individuals 30-50 years old, or as children (less than 18).  You also mentioned larger joints being primarily affected as compared to the small joints of hands and feet.\n\n- Probably not PA/Lupus/Paraneoplastic.\n\n- Could be gout.  Worth getting a test.  If you are a moderate drinker (say 3 or more drinks a week), gout probability would increase, even more so if those drinks are beer (which promote more uric acid). You should look into a uric acid test to rule this out.\n\n- Could be reactive arthritis.  The offending agent could be the covid vaccine, getting a virus, or something entirely different.  This tends to subside when the offending agent is removed, but could last up to 12 months.  If everything comes up negative and symptoms start to resolve over time on their own, this is probably your diagnosis.  Popular Rx drugs can cause recative arthritis.  If you are on any Rx's, that would increase probability.  In three months you have seen a GP, two orthopedics, a dentist, and a rheumatologist?  Seems like you are health-focused and therefore more likely than not to be on a medication or supplements.  Melatonin, a popular OTC sleep aid, is known to cause reactive arthritis and trigger RA flares.  If you are supplement-heavy, you may want to try to wean off and see if that has an impact.  The half-life of some fat-soluble supplements can be weeks, so try to go supplement free for 6 weeks to really see if there is an impact.\n\n- Could be commingling of issues.  Ganglion cysts are not common symptoms of inflammatory arthritis.  You might have a pinched nerve which is separate from your cyst which is separate from your locked jaw.\n\nGood luck.",1649301825,t3_txuo9m,/r/rheumatoid/comments/txuo9m/3_months_in_and_i_am_still_trying_to_figure_out/i3puyz3/

Yet the simplest answer - to treat your debilitating issue with medication that could possibly fix what you‚Äôre complaining about - is to avoid the people who will help you because‚Ä¶ You have ‚Äúother‚Äù issues you don‚Äôt want to deal with. Am I right? \n\nI think your first trip needs to be to the therapist because you‚Äôre seriously neglecting your health. You think you hurt now? Just give yourself a couple years and see how you feel.

There have been times when they have been more worried about it than others based on blood work, severity, and notes made on my overall condition from recent visits. \n\nEither way, you should check with your doctor. Because RA and a lot of the medications used to treat it increase your risks of lung infection. **Also, RA can create nodules within your lungs (I have them) and the leading causes of death for RA patients tend to be infections or respiratory/cardiovascular diseases/complications.** Trust me - this can go from ""mildly annoying"" to ER visit *overnight*. \n\n**So while I do tend to delay and try and wait out most symptoms - respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms shouldn't be fucked with. Let the doctors be the judge on whether or not you should come in.**\n\nHonestly, the only good thing about this pandemic (for me) has been that with limited contact and everyone wearing masks, the last 2 years have been the first in the last 15 years that I haven't had bronchitis or something else lung-related (aside from the nodules, which are permanent) 1-3 times a year. \n\n**Not trying to scare you.

They found a small, singular spot and the pulm told me it's completely normal to have small nodes in your lungs and many people have them with no issues. I didn't have asthma either.

Mine, for example, has created rheumatoid nodules and scarring in my lungs and while currently unconfirmed, there are some signs that RA may be going after my heart. I'm in my early 30s. \n\nAlso, a lot of the most common drugs used to treat RA increase the risk of lung complications.

I've had asthma since birth and had no symptoms to indicate it was anything but asthma, so it was both unnecessary and an expense I couldn't afford (they charged me nearly $600 for a blood test the week prior, I didn't want to even imagine what an x-ray would cost).",1648752603,t3_tt4svx,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tt4svx/paying_for_treatment_when_you_cant_afford/i2vshyh/

Goodrx coupons are fantastic. \n\nThe other thing you can do is have your rheumatologist send a request to the manufacturer for free or discounted drugs. It's a pain in the butt to get on, and even once you're on it, it can be a headache to get them to set it up correctly, but sometimes you can get 6 months to a year approved on their ""patient assistance program"". The requirements usually aren't as ridiculous as government assistance.

i4ca8z5,tt4svx,"i'm so sorry this is happening to you.  several years ago i was in the same boat: no insurance, no government assistance and not enough $$ to cover anything.\n\nmy husband and i actually ended up moving into my parents' home.  at the time there was no way we could work out covering my medical needs and paying rent so we paid a small monthly amount to the family to cover our share of utilities/to help them out.  obviously this very much depends on your relationship with your folks/location/if they have a home large enough.. but if it's a possibility, i would certainly recommend talking with them.  (housing and rental costs are just so ridiculous right now, i refuse to believe this will keep going for long at this rate.  at least i hope so.)\n\nmy advice regarding medication and medical treatment..\n\nif you're on a biologic, contract the drug manufacturer.  because you're not actually on medicaid, you could use whatever coupon code or discount they provide.  i knew someone who personally got enbrel for less than $30 a month back then because of help from the manufacturer.  it's certainly worth a shot.  also, talk to your rheumatologist as well: because you don't have insurance, you're not at their mercy to try different medication.  some manufacturers may have much better assistance plans than others and your doctor might have more info.\n\nif you're not on biologics or are unable to find a cost effective solution, you can certainly try drugs like sulfasalazine, plaquenil or methotrexate.  using resources like goodrx and free pharmacy programs, those drugs can end up being -incredibly- inexpensive.  at the time, i was able to get plaquenil and methotrexate for less than $10 thanks to a program our pharmacy ran for inexpensive generics and coupon codes through vendors like goodrx (i forgot the name of the one we used but i don't think they exist anymore).  i would definitely call your local pharmacies to check into their programs.  one of the supermarkets here (stop and shop) used to have a -FREE- rx program for a list of certain generics!\n\nregarding actually seeing a healthcare provider... especially when it comes to primary care, try looking into nonprofit practices who may actually offer free care!  i was able to continue seeing my primary at the time because (thankfully), they run a special program based on donations where patients who don't have insurance can actually see their doctor at zero cost.  during the years i lost my insurance, at least i always was able to see my doctor at anytime without having to pay.  (if in the very, very small chance you're in rhode island, it's well one!)  call around- there may also be health clinics that provide free primary care as well (we have a couple here).  the same goes for rheumatology- one of the free clinics here also provides low or no cost specialists.  it's definitely going to be cheaper than normal specialists even if you don't qualify for free visits.\n\ni hope this helps!  if you need help with resources i'm more than happy to help.",1649710405,t3_tt4svx,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tt4svx/paying_for_treatment_when_you_cant_afford/i4ca8z5/

i2x63lx,tt4svx,When it comes to blood work I do know that Quest has payment plans where you can pay things off monthly until the balance is paid in full. They also have assistance programs that provide discounted lab services for those who qualify. I think they have labs nationwide so maybe you can look into that and see if there is one near you.\n\n\nIn terms of appointments I would recommend you call around and ask multiple offices about their self pay price and see what they say. Sometimes they can shock you and they can be lower than you think or they have repeat patient perks. A local company in my area has a self pay repeat patient incentive. For primary care your first appointment would be $100 and then every appointment after that would be $70. This incentive would apply as long as you've gone to them within 4 years. It applied to specialists too with slightly different prices. Maybe you could come across something like that. Also prices vary a lot between medical offices. I've called around and got prices ranging $70 to $180 for urgent care. It really helps to shop around.\n\n\nAlso for regular sick things that you could go to urgent care for I would suggest asking if any of them have any programs. My husband went without insurance for a bit when I was on my mom's and we found an urgent care in our area that had this cool patient plan. You could pay $300 one time and that would cover your payment for your visits for a whole year and it would also significantly discount your labs and imaging. My husband got labs drawn there for a few different things and it only cost $45. He also had x rays done at a very low price as well.\n\n\nThank you for the well wishes and no problem!

You're not dehydrated, it's just the drug leaving your body.\n\nETA - forgot to address the fertility/toxicity, which is funny because I'm a toxicologist...\nI'm not clear if you're currently medicated and this is a switch or you're just starting to consider going on a DMARD.\nThe effect on sperm from sulfazalazine is reversible, fortunately. The human spermatogenesis cycle is 74 days, so it takes a couple months to recover. Sperm count and motility are affected and potentially the acrosome reaction (allows a sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida [essentially the shell] of the egg). So, if you're TTC near term it's probably better to wait on starting this drug.\n\nMethotrexate may have some effects on male fertility as well, although the data there are mixed and may have a background influence of uncontrolled disease vs an effect on spermatogenesis. Hydroxychloroquine seems to not affect male fertility/sperm quality.\n\nInterestingly, TNF-alpha inhibitors may improve sperm quality in patients. It's probably due to the pharmacology because high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are bad for fertility.\n\nUntreated disease can affect your sperm count, depending on how sick you are. So, keep that in mind when thinking about treatment options.\n\nNice recent open access review: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600290/",1648488132,t3_tq62bh,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tq62bh/sulfasalazine/i2glocm/

You definitely need a rheumatologist to fully investigate this. Make sure to tell them about your family history of autoimmune.\n\nFor joint pain, the most conclusive test to determine if it is caused by inflammatory arthritis is: joint ultrasound or MRI on affected joints (must be done when you are actively having symptoms). This imaging is the only way to fully investigate the possibility of arthritis. If a doctor tells you that you don't have arthritis due to blood test results or X rays, they are dismissing you without doing thorough enough testing.

There's the shock, eventual acceptance. There's the mourning for who you were and what you thought your life would be, and there's anger and fear. I'm not sure it ever totally goes away (much like grieving for a loved one) but it becomes less raw and it knocks the wind out of you less often. \n\nHave you had your vitamin d and b12 levels checked?

The hope you need to keep is for a day where the pain isn‚Äôt as bad because better days are ahead! Getting meds right takes time no matter the illness so be patient. This is life changing, but you have to remind yourself- it could be worse. I went to critical care hospitals and that‚Äôs when I realized arthritis wasn‚Äôt the worst thing that could happen to me so I‚Äôll take it.\n\nMy biggest advice is take the preventatives. I didn‚Äôt. I was naive and my left wrist fused so I basically have a Barbie wrist. It started up my elbow and that‚Äôs when I finally caved but the damage is done. Same thing with my spine. I could‚Äôve prevented it all had I not been so bitter.\n\nAs far as family goes, they won‚Äôt understand. No one does until they experience it so for comfort, talk openly here or read to keep yourself sane. Your pain is very real.

I had some incredibly kind teachers and some who didn‚Äôt understand and would tell my parents I was doing ‚Äúthe bare minimum‚Äù (fortunately they understood that wasn‚Äôt the truth). Your exhaustion and pain are part of the illness and you deserve to feel seen and heard by your doctors, family, teachers, and friends.

When I started Enbrel, I was having horrible injection site reactions and my doc was able to get me onto Xeljanz (also a JAK inhibitor like one of the others commented above). It was a lifesaver because I had no side effects and it really improved my quality of life. I‚Äôm not sure if this is an option at your age, but I was in my early twenties when I started it.

But, there are tricks like adding methotrexate to the humira that can help. Also, I think enbrel is approved for pediatric, it has the same drug target as humira, so should be effective for you. Also golimumab (simponi). Ask your doctor. Do you tell your doctor about the non-joint symptoms?\n\nhttps://www.enbrel.com/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis\n\nMight it be worth handing over responsibility of taking your humira to someone else if you can't do it on schedule? I get really squirrelly about my injection and have to tell my husband it's injection day and he basically makes sure I take it, so it's not merely your age which makes it hard to do, and not a necessary part of growing up to hand the responsibility over to you. In fact, when my husband is away one of my kids takes over in reminding me.\n\nBy taking it late you allow your immune system to rebound, causing a flare and also potentially allowing it to develop an antibody to the drug, rendering it useless.\n\nYour symptoms sound like your disease is not controlled to me, that's what I feel like when mine isn't. It's that bone deep fatigue and ache. I often don't realise until it's gone. Usually I think I'm lazy and ridiculous, then it goes away with a new drug and I'm like ohhhhhhh.\n\nYou should also be aware that inflammation causes depression.

i22lfke,tnbtis,"***EDITED as I just looked up his Youtube channel: RED flag! One of his first videos is ""Fix Rheumatoid Arthritis in 3 Steps"" - NOPE! I had also flagged his Instagram and used it for patient education specific to avoiding red flag claims when looking for members of your RA support team. I personally would not encourage anyone to go with him.***\n\nI'm in a unique position to answer this as I've been an RA patient for 19 years and I also have a masters in Occupational Therapy. I also run online support groups and ""self-management"" programs which can overlap with what coaches provide (eg I teach *evidence-based* tips (providing links to evidence for every tip) for how to prevent and reduce fatigue, track symptoms, manage stress, adopt health-promoting habits like sleep, nutrition & exercise, manage social life, etc).\n\n**THE TLDR version of my take is**: RA ""coaches"" and chronic illness coaches in general are *not necessarily a scam*, but there is absolutely no quality control or oversight to regulate them. So, mileage will vary depending on the person's true intentions (eg helping people v money only), qualifications (any training / actual expertise?) and claims (what are they claiming is the outcome of their coaching and is their method for achieving that legit / valid)?\n\n**The nuanced answer is: there is a gigantic spectrum of how ""good"" health coaches can be, depending on two major things: their claims, and their qualifications.**\n\n**What do I mean by their ""claims?"" Look out for red flags like:**\n\n* I will ""eliminate pain"" or help you ""live pain free."" There is no evidence for any method to eliminate pain. However there are evidence based ways to reduce / prevent pain and cope with pain. The less ""exciting"" the claims are, the more likely they are to be legit (eg ""help you prevent and manage pain"" versus ""I will ANNIHILATE YOUR PAIN!)\n* **""Fix,"" ""Heal"" or ""cure""** your condition. There's no cure and I personally don't resonate with the concept of ""healing"" my gut or my RA, although some do.\n* ""I know something doctors / big pharma doesn't want you to know""\n* ""I healed my RA and you can too"" or ""I did X for my condition and you can too!"" This is one that occurs from people most often who have GOOD intentions, but don't understand the nuances of healthcare. Some people go gluten free and feel amazing, some go gluten free and feel like shit still (raising my hand here haha). Just because something worked for one person doesn't provide evidence it will work for another. Unfortunately that's a nuance some well-intentioned people don't get.\n* Anyone who dismisses the effectiveness of medications for RA in favor of natural only routes (the evidence is so overwhelming in favor of pharmaceutical interventions for RA that I consider it unethical to scare anyone away from trying meds)\n\n**What do I mean by their qualifications/training?**\n\n* Did they have to do any official program to be a health coach or is it just based on their ""own research?"" There are some somewhat suspicious ones I've seen that are all about ""holistic coaching"" that are only 6 or 8 weeks; it seems that the[""National Society of Health Coaches""](https://www.nshcoa.com/) is a bit more legit but it's for people who are already health providers.\n* If they did an official health coaching / life coaching program, how long was it and how rigorous was it?\n* Do they have any healthcare experience/training? For example, Stefanie Remson (full disclosure, she's a social media friend of mine who's become a ""Real life"" friend) is a nurse practitioner who also offers RA coaching, plus she's an RA patient as well. I would trust her opinion more than someone who didn't have a healthcare background on certain matters.\n* Do they have ""real life"" patient experience? I know some amazing personal trainers living with rheumatoid arthritis who also provide health coaching / personal training coaching; there's no substitute for someone who ""gets it!"" The only caution I'd put here is that I've noticed some patients make a change in their lifestyle (eg new diet / exercise plan) and then erroneously believe that what worked for them will work for everyone else with the same condition.\n\n**I think health coaches can be very helpful, but need to be evaluated on an individual basis.** People with rheumatoid arthritis are given *very little support* for navigating daily living challenges, adopting health-promoting behaviors, \*how\* to exercise, track symptoms, etc. **As many of you in the comments already mentioned, the basics are really obvious for RA - eat healthy, move your body, sleep enough and manage stress - but many people have a hard time with the ""HOW"" even if they know the ""WHAT"" to do, and coaches can provide accountability.** \n\nSo, while some in the licensed healthcare industry (fellow physical therapists, occupational therapists, rheumatologists, etc) are completely dismissive of coaches because they don't have the same training as a licensed health provider and could *potentially* be snake oil salesmen, I think that there's potential for them to be very helpful. There also is some evidence for health coaching in general helping people manage chronic conditions, that's why health insurance programs are starting to pay for health coaches for people with diabetes, RA, etc.\n\nIn the chronic illness community I've connected to some great coaches, many of whom have RA themselves, because in my core I believe patients deserve *every possible avenue of support* that might help them. I wouldn't ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" per se but I would again evaluate the potential coach with a critical eye.\n\nI'd be happy to give you my 2 cents on this person's website if you'd like.

I know your instinct is to force yourself to take care of some things, so here is a cautionary tale. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, I was in a flare. Since I was working from home, I thought, ‚ÄúHey, I can just power through it, right?‚Äù\n\nMonday of the week, I fell getting the mail and broke my wrist. Friday of the same week, I fell in the bathroom and broke my ankle. Both times I was just rushing around like I had good sense. I ended up in the hospital for almost 6 weeks. I would have done myself a favor by staying in bed that week. And I should have been slowing way down. \n\nOnly do what makes you happy right now. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up. See if your Rheumy can possibly squeeze you in since you are in so much pain. If not, go to your GP. Pain-stress-pain-stress is a vicious cycle. Definitely ask for some prednisone and something for pain other than Celebrex. The prednisone knocks down the inflammation pretty well. And it gets easier to think if you can knock back the pain. Desperate times call for desperate measures!\n\nSince it‚Äôs causing you to miss work, if you are in the US, get with your doctor and file for FMLA ASAP. It has saved my job several times since I‚Äôm not being penalized for the days I have to take off. \n\nDM me if you want to talk privately.

i1whg6e,tlz8c8,"You are sweet to be so supportive. RA is an autoimmune disease. This means her own immune system has mistakenly identified stuff in her body (the tissue between the joints in the bones) as a foreign substance to be eliminated. When you get sick (cold, flu, etc), your immune system kicks in and has an inflammatory response (like a fever) to kill the thing making you sick. With RA, your body is having an inflammatory response to something it shouldn‚Äôt. Here are some tips for both of you:\n\n1. RA is more than just joint pain. The fatigue can be really tough. It takes a lot of understanding from loved ones, friends, and family because there will be times that your girlfriend will have to back out of plans, or not be able to do something, because of the fatigue. \n\n2. She won‚Äôt always feel bad, but it takes time to feel better. It takes a few months for the medication to really start doing it‚Äôs job. But once she‚Äôs on a good medication regimen, she will be in ‚Äúremission‚Äù and feel normal. \n\n3.  The drugs suppress the immune system so it stops attacking the body. This makes the person VERY susceptible to other infections. If you, or anyone else in your social circle have even a cold, she WILL get it, her symptoms will be more severe, and she will take longer to recover. Do her a favor and help her by staying away if you are sick, and having her wear a mask if there is any risk of infection. Your social circle, and her coworkers, should know that exposing her to everyday viruses is not good. \n\n4. Beyond joint pain, she may experience a lot of other discomfort: Dry eyes (get Systane Eye Drops), Chronic Fatigue (naps and know when to say no!), and others. If you can communicate well and she‚Äôs honest about how she‚Äôs feeling day to day, it‚Äôs helpful in the relationship. \n\n5. For the joint pain: Naproxin, compression gloves and socks, a prescription for Diclofenac Sodium Topical Gel, CBD (If legal where you are‚Ä¶and the Delta 8 stuff is crap. Get the real thing), ice packs, heating pads. If you learn some gentle massage, that would really help when she‚Äôs having a flare. \n\n6. She should not stop exercising. Even a gentle walk. It‚Äôs SUPER hard to keep this habit when you are having a flare. It seems counterintuitive to exercise when your feet hurt and you are tired, but in the end, the exercise makes you feel better. \n\n7. Keep a journal of how you feel daily. There are apps for this also. Not only does this help when you go in for your quarterly check up, it can help identify if you have any triggers that cause a flare up. Some people have food triggers, or sleep triggers. Some people have trouble when the weather changes.\n\nThat said, now that my medications are correct, I feel totally normal. There are days I forget I have RA. If she takes good care of herself, this disease can me managed. Good luck!!",1648104971,t3_tlz8c8,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tlz8c8/my_girlfriend_just_got_told_she_has_ra/i1whg6e/
i1wiwtn,tlz8c8,"RA is like your body trying to fight a cold, except the thing it thought was a cold is really your joints (and sometimes organs). So, to fight this 'cold' it throws all it's energy into the immune response, which drains all the energy you would have had to: work out, do chores, play with a pet (if you have one), walk up the stairs, etc.\n\nEssentially your body is trying to destroy itself and you need medicine to calm it down and make it 'lazy' to fighting off infections (real and imagined).\n\nThe best bet to helping her, is to offer to do stuff when she's tired. If she seems tired or in pain and you guys take turns at household stuff, offer to do hers for the day. Remind her it's okay to rest when she feels tired or in pain and that it's not being lazy. Also, offer suggestions like laying on the couch and watching something, maybe ordering in food, etc on bad days. Making something good out of a bad day can really make it bareable to live with. \n\nThe best thing she can do is to listen to her own body. If something hurts, don't try to push through, rest for a few minutes and see if it helps. Showers can help first thing in the morning for really sore joints (but if she's having bad fatigue, switch to a bath). She should also tell her rheumatologist every symptom she has, they can't help if they don't know. \n\nIt can be frustrating for both of you as she has ups and downs, just remember it takes time to find the right treatment. She may never be 100% again but she can also get lucky and go into remission. Each medicine can take 2 to 6 months to work and she may go through many of them, so both of you just have to remember that in the frustrating times.",1648106185,t3_tlz8c8,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tlz8c8/my_girlfriend_just_got_told_she_has_ra/i1wiwtn/

i1xfegn,tlz8c8,"I love this response. The only thing I would add is in terms of the exercise comment. I really struggled with exercise intolerance in the beginning. I'd get extremely nauseous, GI issues (I have vomited), head aches, increased pain and fatigue and higher fevers even from just doing yoga or a low impact 10 minute video for elders, I was diagnosed at 23. Walking down the sidewalk was extremely difficult as it would make me pretty sick. If exercise is difficult for her there are some awesome resources out there for adapting. Doing exercises laying down or seated is still beneficial. Someone on Reddit recommended prenatal yoga and Pilates since a lot of it is done on your back. I really like activelyautoimmune on Instagram, she has awesome adapted exercises. I also really like itsmegzz_fitness, she has really awesome videos on Instagram for exercising with RA. \n\n\nAlso since I've already mentioned adapting I just want to mention one more thing. It's okay if she needs to adapt certain things that are a part of her daily routine. For example on days where my feet and ankles are killing me or I'm extremely fatigued I tend to fold my laundry and do the dishes sitting down. It seems small but it makes a big difference. It helps save energy but it also helps reduce pain. I still stand when I'm well enough but some days I sit. Doing this isn't lazy, it's a part of pain management and rationing energy. The fatigue isn't the same as just being tired. For me it can feel like I'm walking through quicksand with cinder blocks stacked on top of me. Everything from getting up off the couch to cooking dinner can be a struggle when fatigue is involved.

i1qimgw,tkfo46,"Am not quite an expert on RA yet, but I do work in the lab and have performed all of these tests so I am very familiar them.\n\nComplement C3, CRP, and sed rate are all basically just measurements of how much inflammation is going on in your body. So lower values = less inflammation, which makes sense because Prednisone is an anti-inflammatory drug.\n\nANA, RF, and anti-CCP are tests that detect certain types of autoantibodies. With the ANA there is a threshold of what will be detected and anything below that threshold is reported as negative even if you still have the antibodies. Antibodies are produced as part of the inflammatory process so less inflammation = less antibodies.\n\nLymphocytes are the white blood cells that produce antibodies and mediate the inflammatory response...

i1uzhfh,tkfo46,"So I am definitely not qualified to give any kind of specific advice but I can try to explain how to interpret those results.\n\nCRP like I stated in my first comment is just a measure of inflammation. It's *extremely* non specific and will increase in response to any inflammatory process - it can go up if you have a cold, if you get an injury, if you are stressed, if you're having a heart attack, literally anything that triggers an inflammatory response. So an elevated CRP doesn't really say anything other than ""there is inflammation somewhere in your body"".\n\nSed rates are similar in that it is not specific and will change in response to any type of inflammation. Changes in sed rate usually lag behind changes in CRP, [this graph](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3ee2240bb4ee92971c888378ca15a0e7/tumblr_p76ru0yuzV1qz5e1po1_400.gifv) shows how they will respond to a single inflammatory event (like an injury). It will be a bit more complicated than that with a chronic disease process but hopefully that kind of gives you an idea of how they behave.\n\nSo in short, when CRP and/or sed rate go up, that says ""there is an increasing amount of inflammation somewhere in your body"" and when they go down that says ""there is a decreasing amount of inflammation somewhere in your body"" but it doesn't say anything about the cause of either change. Prednisone is an anti-inflammatory so it is plausible that a course of prednisone will lead to a decrease in inflammation and thus a decreased CRP and/or sed rate, but prednisone is also a very non-specific drug so it still doesn't say anything about the cause of the inflammation. \n\nI hope this all made sense! üòÖ",1648076452,t1_i1urx8w,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tkfo46/ana_and_sed_rates/i1uzhfh/

i1vk72a,tkfo46,"Have you reached out to Pfizer or the FDA and reported to them what happened after you got the vaccine?\n\nThere are a combination of blood tests, joint tests etc. I for one feel like RA is becoming the diagnosis of the lazy internist or rheumatologist.\n\nFor instance - I have generations of this in my family. The men usually have ankylosing spondylitis and half of the women were diagnosed as juveniles with RA and the rest after menopause. Then some of the women have a combination of ankylosing spondylitis + RA. Genetics play a big role in disease severity but almost always there is a triggering event like a trauma or allergic reaction - something severe that sets it off. My brother has AS, was diagnosed at 19 six months after having a minor slip and fall on ice while away at college in Vermont. He was then in a car accident in his mid-40s that put him into remission then after losing his oldest son it is now back with a vengeance. Me on the other hand - I have always been sick. For years I felt better at a high altitude versus sea level but now that no longer matters. My point is that this is like throwing spaghetti on the ceiling. If you come from certain ethnic groups you have a higher chance than the rest of the population but you need to educate yourself on everything. Like my liver tests go up and down but I eat foods that ""cleanse"" the liver like raw cabbage is like my Wonder Woman food. If I could eat that everyday and not get bored of it my liver enzymes would be in the normal range.\n\nSo I am rambling now but I would start by calling Pfizer and if you don't get anywhere send me a message or send me a message and let me know if they told you anything.\n\nHang in there!",1648085556,t1_i1vcbfn,/r/rheumatoid/comments/tkfo46/ana_and_sed_rates/i1vk72a/

Like the others on this thread I cannot offer you anything other than there will be good days and bad days. My advice is to get a good Rheumatologist and get on an effective drug regimen asap. You will find in your journey that your effective meds will eventually quit working as your body builds up a tolerance. As soon as you realize that is beginning to happen start to coordinate with your doctor what the next step is. If you wait too long there can be a gap in getting the next effective medication. This happened to me recently and I basically spent 2021 in bed. The Actemra is finally relieving the inflammation and allowing me to get back out into the world. The thing about all these drugs we take is that they are meant to suppress or trick our immune system so that it will quit attacking our joints. In my case after all these years of taking the heavy duty anti inflammatory drugs my immune system is really compromised. For that reason I will probably continue to wear a mask. Hang in there.

i1r9ik2,tkbey9,"Yes. Absolutely. I think people (including myself) expect a medication failure to feel as bad as pre-diagnosis. It's not. Onset is much more insidious and it's easy to talk yourself into thinking you're just being a whiner or you got injured or whatever. I only had one joint flare when my meds failed (ankle), and I nursed it like a running injury for 6 months before I finally switched meds, and then it took 15 months to get under control. At minimum you need a steroid burst to see if your meds can maintain status quo if steroids knock out the active inflammation. But more than likely you need different medication!

I've started taking a daily multi-vitamin as well as magnesium and B complex -- they seem to help tremendously with swelling and stiffness-- and I stay on loratadine no matter what (we get it here without a prescription). Hot baths and compresses do the trick for me for most of the pain. Rest also helps, sometimes sleep is the *only* thing that makes me feel better.\n\nStress is the one thing that all of my really bad flares have in common. More than anything, try not to be hard on yourself, your RA is hard enough on you already. That's the way I see it. There's a fine line between self-pity and acceptance, so I battle every day to not feel sorry for myself (it only leads to depression) and to continue to just count my blessings, being grateful for what I do have, for what I can do, and for what others do for me.\n\nI don't know if you have any support system around you, but I hope and pray that you do. In my case, I've always been very independent and losing that is the worst part for me. Not being able to wield my hammer-drill or move furniture anymore, or even wash dishes sometimes, has been hard on me psychologically for two main reasons. First off, I really don't want to bother anyone to help me, but more than that, I think I'm having a hard time accepting that there are things I just can't or shouldn't do anymore -- because nobody tells *me* what to do LOL.\n\nIt isn't easy, we know.
