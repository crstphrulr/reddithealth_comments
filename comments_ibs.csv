First thing they covered in my intro class for my program (health science) was how bad that was \n\nI take a daily multivitamin, Prozac, and I‚Äôm on depo provera. \n\nBloodwork for thyroid and iron, B12, liver function is normal. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had anything else done. My NP who is basically my primary care doctor (I live very rurally and I‚Äôve never actually seen my family doc since I was like 5) told me to eat more fibre and drink more water and no testing needed. My uncle is gluten sensitive, and my cousin has chrons. My dad said he used to get bad stomachs a lot when he was young, but now he exclusively eats whole grains and he seems fine. Endometriosis is a possibility, as menstrual issues are why I‚Äôm on the depo at double the normal dose, but the ultrasound was clean. \n\nI‚Äôve been on lactulose since I was a small child, the doctor told my parents it was no harm to take it regularly. In my life I‚Äôll usually do two tablespoons when I‚Äôve been constipated for a week and I haven‚Äôt had any movement. It usually works like a charm but this time- well, see the description in my post.",1651200363,t1_i6m81ro,/r/ibs/comments/ueb5mq/advice_regular_flare_up_or_time_to_go_to_an_er/i6maczx/

It‚Äôs really simple to use and you can do quick search for things when you‚Äôre at the store buying your groceries if you‚Äôre unsure about a food. \n\nYou could also watch this NHS video which explains the fodmap diet in detail https://youtu.be/mhfEH9yc7MQ\n\nIn addition to Monash I use MyFitnessPal which helps me keep track of what I eat (and the calories) so if something causes problems I can pinpoint the ingredient and put it on my no go list. \n\nFYI leek stems are high in fructans which is likely why you had some problems with your soup. \n\nGood luck.,1651215377,t3_udwao7,/r/ibs/comments/udwao7/trying_to_lose_weight_but_struggling_because_so/i6myx3t/

i6j7nei,udtup8,"It sucks. \n\nI‚Äôve always had a delicate system but it got so bad for me. I was teaching, couldn‚Äôt leave a classroom alone for a sudden bathroom emergency. I was forced to quit, it was truly disabling in that environment, and the stress took its toll in other ways too. \n\nThere were a lot of things I tried. Liquid diet, low FODMAP, but fasting was the only sure way I could get through a day without an emergency. I lost so much weight. Impossible to eat a days worth of calories by the time I got done with work. If you can eat nuts, they‚Äôre pretty calorie dense for eating a small handful every hour or two. I resented surviving like a fuckin squirrel. So I looked for remote work. \n\nI‚Äôm starting a new remote job that trains in-person too. \n\nMy doctor prescribed me an anti-spasm medication (dicylomine) that I found to be more helpful than Imodium. It works faster. Not fast enough for a hostage situation like being the only adult supervising 40 minors, but fast enough I can take one before a presentation in a normal office setting and not get sick. \n\nThat training period will suck. I WILL need to vanish. I have not officially registered my disability with my new employer because I want to see what happens first. That said, privately saying something upfront to HR or the training supervisor like ‚ÄúI have a medical issue that requires frequent appointments. I‚Äôm not fully recovered and sometimes I need to leave unexpectedly. Is there a way I can get study guides or materials to go over at home if this happens?‚Äù \n\nDuring Covid a lot of places had to do all of this remotely so the answer is probably going to be yes. Or if you‚Äôre training with other new hires, ask them for a recap (offer to do a favor in return). Also, it‚Äôs still a pandemic. Lots of people have lingering Covid effects, and you won‚Äôt be the only person HR/training hears this request from. \n\nGenerally my plan is to eat nuts, sip broth, maybe have a soup or yogurt for lunch if things are going ok. But if things aren‚Äôt going ok I do intermittent fasting and your body actually gets used to this after a few days, you don‚Äôt feel hunger all day long. \n\nAll of your frustration is legitimate but dont feel ashamed. I go through periods of laughing at my condition and other times being so bummed I cry. You get to a point where you are just unapologetically blunt with friends ‚ÄúOutdoor festivals sound like a portapotty hellscape NO thanks‚Äù and it becomes less stressful as a lifestyle adjustment. \n\nYou‚Äôve been through a lot, so there probably isn‚Äôt much to feel grateful for - but practicing gratitude with a journal keeps my thought cycles elsewhere. The mind is a huge part of managing it so anxiety meds were a good call. \n\nWriting about it is helpful too. You came to the right place.

i6gvzvw,ud0ou0,Ok so I‚Äôve had to deal with this my entire life (quite refreshing to see other ppl have to deal with this as well) and basically my understanding of it is that certain foods for us create more gas for most people in our stomachs and the gas ends up trapped in this section of the colon and you are kind of handicapped by the pain until you excrete the gas after a long period of time. \n\nIn recent years however I have had to deal with this less and less. I‚Äôm 22 now but I had to deal with it pretty much every other day from ages 8-20 \n\nSome of the things I‚Äôve changed in recent years that have had a positive effect are: \n\n-Not eating 3 hours before bed ( I realised I was usually waking up with it as a result of it being triggered in the night) \n\n- using a tennis ball or hard object to dislodge the trapped gas \n\n-i don‚Äôt know if this one is correlated but as I got a stronger core as a result of doing more exercise when it was triggered it felt like it hurt less and I think developing better posture in general helped with this \n\n-there were also some foods and drinks that I realised over time triggered it worse (mostly alcohol and fizzy drinks) so avoiding those helps. If I had beer or cider I would usually be bedbound for the next 12 hours \n\nAnyways feel free to message me about it if you want,1651103595,t3_ud0ou0,/r/ibs/comments/ud0ou0/dae_with_ibs_have_sharp_pain_in_the_upper_left/i6gvzvw/

But for me I know how my different IBS symptoms feel and usually what they mean ad how to make them feel better. When my GI doc suggested that this pain in my lower left quadrant  (right under where op says they have pain) was gas or constipated I did get a little heated. Especially since I also have new frequent regurgitation that he think increasing my dose of omeprazole is appropriate and not listening when I say it's not helping. I think if someone gets heated about it during a new ibs diagnosis then maybe they should listen to their doc a bit more.

I ignored the pain (which almost felt like cramps mixed with a pulled muscle or something), until it came to a head. I developed a low grade fever and almost passed out one afternoon and the pain increased tenfold. Had to go to ER and they did a CT scan which showed diverticulitis. Idk if that is helpful but I truly wish I had known about diverticulitis sooner because I Wouldn‚Äôt have ignored the pain by just assuming it was only ibs. I could have started antibiotics to treat the infection. \n\nTypically diverticulitis is seen in older adults but I‚Äôm a lucky anomaly and developed my first bout at the age of 26 (F).\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that I then had a colonoscopy which found only a few diverticula which made the Dr even more confused as to how I developed the infection.

Could also be diet.\n\nLet's look at some factors, first:\n\n\n- What do you typically eat in a day?\n- What is your fluid intake like?\n- What is your exercise routine like? How much and how often? What kind?\n- Do you drink, smoke, do drugs, or vape?\n- Do you take any other medications, supplements, or vitamins?\n- Have you had any tests done?\n\nLet me know about those. I can offer input. \n\nFor PFD, you need proper testing. This includes an anorectal manometry and defecogram. This is best done by a motility GI or neurogastroenterologist at a university hospital motility clinic. I have a database if you need a suggestion where to go.

Another good one that's a little less acidic and cheap as hell is the wine Gazella, which is a kitchen sink blend from Portugal.\n\nIf you do a rose be careful of white zinfandels and cheap rose from the states, they are full of a bunch of stuff like stabilizers and preservatives that can be hard on digestion.

Overall you need to drink 2L of fluid and it's spread out so it's not too terrible, I know someone who did moviprep and said it was LOADS worse. \n\nDo a low residue diet for a couple of days before you do the prep as that will make it easier to clear the poo out.

The info below is a copy paste but hopefully it has some useful info, if you're at breaking point from this I highly recommend trying some form of cannabis for relief, it's been a life changer for managing mine.\n\nThis stuff has a massive impact on my mental health when it's not under control, I hope you're coping alright.\n\nPaste:\n\nI don't suffer specifically from IBS-D but I have chronic diarrhea from bile acid malabsorption post gallbladder removal.\n\nBAM causes me urgent watery diarrhea starting around 8am and then roughly hourly or 20 minutes after eating regardless of what food, tried an elimination diet. The toilet aftermath looks like bright vivid yellowy green bile in the water and paper, if I've eaten fat there'll be a greasy film and the poo always floats due to high fat content.\n\nI initially managed with imodium and a bile binder called colestid which stops the bile running through your system resulting in diarrhea, you should look into BAM because a decent amount of people with IBS D suffer from this as well / instead.\n\nI lived my life with the above medication as needed for about two and a half years, I wouldn't eat outside the house and severely limited my social outings, in and out of depression constantly.\n\nDiagnosis is easy, if a bile binder works that's the likely cause. It's nasty as to drink and about 85% effective in my experience.\n\nNow I've found relief with medical marijuana and have gone from 5-10 bouts of urgent diarrhea to 1-2 normal motions with an open diet. It takes a few months to build up enough tolerance to function normally on it at an effective dose, it's been a life changer and I don't live miserably in fear of leaving the house and shitting every hour.\n\nI'm a massive advocate and think everyone suffering from this who is in a position to do so, should try cannabis in some form to see if it works. All we really have is anecdotal evidence but if you dig around you'll find many getting relief with this.\n\nI hope you find something that works for you as well, stay strong.",1650921787,t3_ubvku9,/r/ibs/comments/ubvku9/struggling_tonight/i66lsvc/

i67b4nb,ubtwgh,"There are different levels of sedation and GA may be considered one of them - it seems to vary, and so does what else I'm about to say. For a colonoscopy you might be very lightly sedated, moderately sedated, or to all intents and purposes, asleep. The only gas is oxygen, and they may be able to do that immediately after you're asleep if you can't tolerate it. It is removed before you wake up. When you say ""gas and air"", do you mean nitrous oxide (I think it is)? I believe an IV in your arm is more likely than sedation by gas. Oxygen has a weird sort of faint smell, not unpleasant, but having never had nitrous oxide, I don't know how it compares.\n\nGeneral anaesthetic is more involved as they need to help you in breathing. The worst part of this is after you're asleep, and before you wake up. Many clinics cannot do GA. However, given that you're in the UK, it's more likely to be in a hospital where they do have the abilities. But the NHS is not for profit so you're not going to get GA just by asking for it. I *have* had GA for a procedure that is normally done under mild sedation but I had complicating factors that made it more appropriate. Perhaps your autism would nudge it that way.\n\nAs for benzo tapering, I don't know how that fits in with sedation. You really need to talk to your doctor about that. Unfortunately it seems extremely rare to meet your anaesthetist until the day of, or even moments before, the procedure. Make sure your concerns make it to your records because verbal reassurances might not be written down and will be forgotten by the time of the procedure. Having said that, the consent form may be specific about the level of sedation used so you can check at that time.",1650932725,t1_i66x8oh,/r/ibs/comments/ubtwgh/uk_users_what_are_nhs_tests_for_ibs/i67b4nb/

I'm afraid to leave my house because I'm afraid of losing control in public. It's struggle to get through an 8-hour work shift. \n\nEdit: there's also excessive burping that goes along with my gas and bloating. And not uncommon for me to get heartburn easily. And sometimes it feels like it can be hard to swallow starchy foods. I can struggle with white rice which is really frustrating because it's one of the few foods that my stomach can handle without issue.\n\nAnd thinks I've changed over the past few months. I've been dealing with trapped gas. Which is incredibly weird to still have bloating, to still have excessive gas that I'm trying to keep in, and then also on top of that have gas it doesn't want to come out when I'm in a safe space.\n\nAnd almost everything I eat makes me feel like I have to go to the bathroom minutes afterwards, sometimes during a meal.\n\nAnd when I do go to a bathroom, typically between 3 and 5 times a day on an average day, it's never solid.

At one point it had been so long since I had a normal solid healthy movement, that I thought something was wrong and I went to the hospital.\n\nA lot of the things that are supposed to help people make things worse for me. I tried eating more fiber. I've tried fiber supplements, like those powders that you mix in with a drink.

Probiotics made things a whole lot worse until I switched to Schiff's Digestive Advantage. Same as with certain types of kombuchas though, I don't know if it's helping I just know that it's not making it worse.\n\nSurprisingly enough though some of the best reactions I've had to food was to seitan. So which is a vegan substitute meat made from vital wheat gluten. So I guess I don't have a gluten intolerance? Maybe that's something to do with the amount of protein that's packed into it? I don't know.\n\nI also have a whole list of other problems that are most likely unrelated. But I can't help it wonder if they are connected. I was diagnosed with depression using age. Been taking antidepressants for most of my life. But apparently 90% of the body serotonin develops in the gut. So maybe I'm depressed because my body can't hold on to serotonin? I'll support gut health has been linked to skin conditions, which could explain my excessive dandruff my entire life, and the fact that I can scar so easily.\n\nI know this isn't true, but I can't help with daydream and wonder if all of my legs problems would be solved if I can fix my IBS.\n\nThe stress and anxiety of it makes me feel like a disgusting troll so I don't even bother trying to date. I can't do any kind of job that requires a lot of mental concentration cuz I'm too busy concentrating on not shitting myself.

There are plenty of research lines over possible ""diseases"" that cause IBS symptoms, but you'll be lucky if you find a doctor who happens to be doing that kind of research (and only if you are in the US or UK, for us who live in 3rd world countries, there's no hope of that).\n\nSo, once you understand, really grok that, you will understand why they are going to give you either sugar pills to ""ease"" your symptoms (imodium if you have diharrhea or fiber, meveberine and dimeticone if you have constipation); some will go as far as prescribing antidepressants, which may or may not work for you. And that's all. Some are going to tell you to ""watch your diet"", but nothing specific. because THEY DON'T KNOW. At that point your doctors will be basically just guessing. \n\nWhat you have to do is find what you see works for YOU. I would suggest to try everything. Don't let any stone unturned.  I  struggled badly with IBS-C for 20 years:  From when I was in Uni and 20 years old, to when I turned about 40.  I had  all kinds of studies, analyses, and whatnot. I ate all kinds of diets and supplements. Some did good at some point, some did bad (peppermint capsules where dead for me for example).  At the end I found what worked for me: Some specific probiotics (after having tried several different probiotics that did nothing), it was all trial and error. But fortunately nowadays I consider myself 90% cured as long as I keep taking those probiotics. \n\nBut yeah, coming back to gastro doctors: I went to 5 different gastros in 3 different countries. Some where better than others, some where more ""truthful/sensible"" than others and said ""we'll say IBS because we cannot find anything else"", some even tried some unusual medications (Crohn's medicine like mesalamine!) . Some  really believed me, some didn't really care, and I actually had one who basically told me **never to return to his practice** because as long as he could see I didn't have anything (like really, shouting me ""you don't have anything, you are fine, go away and don't come back until you have some real symptom""... can you imagine?)\n\nAt the end of the day,  Medics are just professionists that do ""pattern matching"". They have had all this time to learn about the patterns in medicine, and learn what A symptoms go with B disease and what X treatment goes with B disease. But what happens with a disease for which there are no treatments in the books? they can't do much but help with the symptoms.  The better Medics will be honest with you and tell you as it is: ""Medicine doesn't know whats wrong with you, and there is no study that can answer that question"".\n\nI compare my ""revelation"" of Medics knowledge to what happens to children when they grow up: When we are kids, we see our parents as these know-all, solve-all entities: My dad and my mom had all the answers to all my problems. If I needed something I would go to them, and they'll have an answer. As we grow up, we start to see that our parents are just humans, trying to deal with life the same way we do it.  After 20 years of dealing with medics, particularly gastroenterologists, I felt the same: Initially you go there expecting their huge widsom and knowledge to help you solve your problem. But as you visit another, and another, you learn that at the end of the day they are as limited as anybody else.",1650921202,t3_ubo949,/r/ibs/comments/ubo949/i_wish_i_had_a_gastroenterologist_that_has_ibs/i66kcl8/

The toilet aftermath looks like bright vivid yellowy green bile in the water and paper, if I've eaten fat there'll be a greasy film and the poo always floats due to high fat content.\n\nI initially managed with imodium and a bile binder called colestid which stops the bile running through your system resulting in diarrhea, you should look into BAM because a decent amount of people with IBS D suffer from this as well / instead.\n\nI lived my life with the above medication as needed for about two and a half years, I wouldn't eat outside the house and severely limited my social outings, in and out of depression constantly.\n\nDiagnosis is easy, if a bile binder works that's the likely cause. It's nasty as to drink and about 85% effective in my experience.\n\nNow I've found relief with medical marijuana and have gone from 5-10 bouts of urgent diarrhea to 1-2 normal motions with an open diet. It takes a few months to build up enough tolerance to function normally on it at an effective dose, it's been a life changer and I don't live miserably in fear of leaving the house and shitting every hour.\n\nI'm a massive advocate and think everyone suffering from this who is in a position to do so, should try cannabis in some form to see if it works.

I've also been hospitalized because of the gas pains and have had colonoscopy and gastroscopy. I was tested positive for H. Pylori and basically told that this bacteria causes my issues. So I went on antibiotics to kill it. I felt great on medications and 4 weeks afterwards, but the symptoms came back (I tested for H Pylori again - negative).\n\nI was once again put on Metronidazole in Dec 2021. Finished the course just before New Year's and, again, had been feeling great until the start of April. My symptoms are back since then.\n\nI was also on FODMAP diet, but here's two things: 1) I had two runs of FODMAP diet. Both lasted 6 months. First try - felt great, cured and forgot about the disease. Started eating normally. Two months later, symptoms are back. Second try - not so good anymore, unfortunately, but still better. **2) I want to live like a normal human being.** That does not necessarily mean eating chips and pizza every three days (though I know people like this and they don't complain on any GI issues). What I seek is basically not worrying about every single meal, every single day and every single social interactions. I was unable to go away last holidays because of this, I stress about food a lot and that's the problem. FODMAP was an absolutely awful experience in the sense that you are so, so restricted. Holidays are no go, you can't eat anything out, you have to be so careful. I don't want this.\n\nI'm currently studying about FMT and really getting real about it. Donors are the main problem, though. I also have 2 others conditions that are most likely connected with the gut microbiome, thus I see a connection there.

i64qp1e,ub4c0e,"I don't even know what's IBS at this point. I may or may not have this, important is the fact that there's something wrong. For me, IBS is a vague term that describes the symptoms of bloating, constipation/diarrhea, stomach pain, etc. Does not tell a single thing. In my opinion, it's just there to categorize the patient, which results in very poor treatment for the affected, because it's often treated nonindividual way.\n\nI've seen multiple doctors. Was put on antibiotics (temporarily helped), but no long-term positive effects. I had also been hospitalized couple of months ago. Diagnozed with H. Pylori. Told it's the cause. Erased the fucker. Didn't help in the end.\n\nI have a rich experience with FODMAP diet as well. Two years ago - my first attempt at it was very promising. Helped a ton, farted normal amounts, no gas pains whatsoever, very confident and happy about my health. Finished the diet after 6 months of restrictions. Symptoms came back after 2 months of normal eating.\n\n2nd run - not so great. There was a significant improvement, but not complete, thus not satisfying. The whole run also lasted 6 months and symptoms came back within a week or two.\n\nI will, hopefully, not do it again, because it's not a good life to live. Exhausting and stressful it is to not be able to have a pizza with your friends or to go away on any holidays, etc.\n\nFrom the link you've provided, I would not be able to relate myself to this.

i67hqyy,ub3fmw,"2.0 refers to that it is 2x the nutrients in the same volume. \n\nIf you have gastroparesis, are you on medication?\n\nMy story is complicated, and I've posted it before, but I'll post it here. It's long. You don't have to read it.\n\n\nI've had issues with my GI symptoms since I was born. I'm almost 40. \n\nTroublesome issues as a kid, but got much worse at age 16 after a terrible rendition of mononucleosis (was hospitalized, etc).\n\nAround age 20, I started getting crazy neurological issues -- my legs would go numb, I was extremely fatigued, burning sensations everywhere. They tested me for MS multiple times (long family history). No issues.\n\nIn my early 20s, I suddenly lost about 60 lbs over a few months, extremely dehydrated, very high liver enzymes (over 600), and was going diarrhea about 30 times a day (no exaggeration). After a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and tests for everything from diabetes to having a liver biopsy, everything was normal other than having celiac disease. I also got amenorrhea at this time, and still have it about 20 years later. Going on a gluten-free diet obviously helped with the celiac and my neurological issues disappeared, so it was diagnosed I had peripheral neuropathy from celiac. My liver enzymes also went back down.\n\nA couple years later, I began pooping a lot of blood with a lot of pain. No fissures, or hemorrhoids. Had all of the tests (barium, CT scan, MRI). Have family history of bowel disease (IBD and colon cancer). More colonoscopy. No big issues were found except some narrowing in my small intestine, which was diagnosed as mild Crohn's and not to do anything until it got worse. It‚Äôs been redacted since. \n\nIt was around this time I pinpointed some foods that would give me a lot of stomach pain -- this was before FODMAPs were a thing -- but essentially, I started a low FODMAP diet here. This helped with some of the extreme pain and gas and bloating. I was visiting the ER pretty frequently at this point.\n\nWell, all these years of extreme diarrhea really screwed up my body. My colon basically felt like it was failing. It took about 10 years for a full diagnosis. During that time I tried every OTC and prescription medication you can imagine.\n\n* Restoralax/Miralax/PEG\n* Milk of magnesia\n* Peppermint (in every capacity), same with Ginger\n* Heather's Tummy Tamers\n* Amitriptyline\n* Misoprostol (a drug meant for abortions)\n* Prucalopride (full dose)\n* linoclotide (full dose)\n\nAnd others that I can't think of. Some of those were combined, too.\n\nSoon after, I was diagnosed with osteoporosis. \n\nAround the same time, I had anorectal manometry, a defecogram and they discovered a lack of pelvic floor capacity. I did biofeedback and failed. Twice. \n\nI've also been a part of two clinical trials, as well as had experimental procedures where I was a guinea pig. During all of this, I also regularly received botox treatments in my anal sphincter. I had a very specialized nerve function and transit test that showed slowing in my colon.\n\nOne of the experiments included, basically, having a pacemaker zapping the nerves in my sphincter to get them to properly work. Had it been successful, it could be implanted in my body and life would have been good. It wasn't successful. (Surprise).\n\nAbout two years ago, my GI's colleague suggested that I try two of my prescription drugs together to see if they helped. Those, combined with 8 doses of miralax a day, plus milk of magnesia, allowed me to leave the house to get to work for a couple of hours. When I followed up with him, he suggested an ostomy. \n\nThe first plan was to get a colostomy, because it is easier to manage and safer to have long term (with my colon in tact). However, around this time, a new GI joined my clinic and she did a special kind of procedure not done in North America. It was like a 9 hour colonoscopy. Unsedated, very painful.\n\nThrough this, we discovered no nerve function in my colon, rectum, or anal sphincter. From there, it was decided the ileostomy was the best move, since we needed to by-pass the full colon.  My results were so remarkable it was featured in a research study. This was all done with a neurogastroenterologist. It was highly recommended at this point as the only last resort for any quality of life, as things were rapidly declining.\n\nI figured I had nothing to lose. I was going to the bathroom 30 times a day, on the toilet or trying to get to a toilet about 8 hours a day, and had zero quality of life. By now, I've also missed the boat on having a family, et cetera.\n\nThe first eight weeks went well, minus some hyponatremia and a blockage. But... \n\nAfter that, I was hospitalized for an emergency bowel blockage with a retraction of my stoma, had an end ileostomy placed, was in a fair amount of postop pain, never healed, lost 20lbs over a month, hospitalized for three months, diagnosed with SMA syndrome and gastroparesis, on TPN, later on elemental feed tube, total colectomy and ileostomy revision during that time, left hospital and then six weeks later, new stoma started prolapsing and ulcerating, options were to revise stoma or get an ileorectal anastomosis. Opted for the latter, had the worst weeks postop but plowed through it. Pelvic floor was worse than ever. Did biofeedback again. Went to pelvic floor physio regularly. Could hardly leave the house or hardly eat. Had a bowel blockage and was rehospitalized about two months post op.\n\nDuring this time also attend a pain clinic and monitored by them and have a psychiatrist to deal with my health failing.\n\nSo then...I was completely incontinent and plowed through diapers.  I go about over 30 times a day. Diapers were so expensive. I was starving. I talked to my surgeon about going back to the stoma and he didn‚Äôt agree. I got a second opinion after much debate and he said he absolutely felt it would be better. Unfortunately with COVID, surgery was up in the air. So I was just waiting for a date and everyday felt impossible.\n\nIt finally came in March after dealing with that for about 8 months. I went into pre-op at 85lbs.\n\nSo, now my ileostomy is back. It‚Äôs been a year. It prolapses severely daily. I was also diagnosed with Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction which is AWFUL and I wouldn't wish on anyone. Trying to get back on TPN. Also was diagnosed with Abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia. \n\nSo basically, I am at:\n\n- Celiac disease (under control, no issues ever)\n- Gastroparesis (okay with medication and diet)\n- CIPO (on medication and hardly works, unfortunately)\n- Nutcracker syndrome (under control, some issues)\n- SMA syndrome (under control, some issues)\n- abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia \n- No more colonic inertia, thanks to the colectomy\n- Rectal inertia and Pelvic floor dysfunction (only an issue when I need to pass mucus with my ileostomy) \n\nIn the past few months I‚Äôve been having bigger complications with my ileostomy so will either be getting a revision of this ileostomy or a kock pouch sometime coming up. I‚Äôm now just on a liquid diet and making sure I don‚Äôt need to go to the ER everyday. They estimate the surgery will be in the fall or winter.\n\nI also had a recent test that confirmed my small bowel is getting worse, and it is progressive and may fail.\n\n\nFeel free to ask questions.",1650935595,t1_i63xulq,/r/ibs/comments/ub3fmw/massive_weight_loss_is_this_my_life_now/i67hqyy/
