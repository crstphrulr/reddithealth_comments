Especially if they were living on chips, pizza, and soda before (not saying she was).  That‚Äôs going to have a drastic impact on the health of any person. \n\nThere is no scientific evidence to support any specific diet having any impact to disease progression. There *is* scientific evidence showing ‚Äòhealthy diets‚Äô (eating real foods in moderate amounts, whether that‚Äôs Mediterranean, Whals, OMS, or just avoiding sugars/processed foods/saturated fats/junk) can have a positive impact on symptoms currently experienced from damage that has already been done.",1651174079,t3_ue2873,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ue2873/various_newcomer_questions/i6kleso/
i6klc5m,ue2873,"Welcome to the new club. Lots to digest here.\n\nStarting with Dr. Wahls. Overall consensus is she is a fraud. I think that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch. I do not believe that she pushes her diet with intent to take advantage of people. I think she believes her diet would help people. If you read her book (sounds like you have), she casually mentions that she took Novantrone. And started her new diet. I believe (going off of memory here) that she saw results after a year or two of starting her diet AND after she took Novantrone. I believe the benefits she saw were not caused by her diet at all. I think that the Novantrone halted her disease activity which allowed her body to begin to heal.\n\nPeople are not tearing Wahls down because her book is a recipe book. That‚Äôs a small piece of her book. People don‚Äôt like her (seemingly) predatory business model. And she comes off far more anti-treatment by the end of the book than she lets on in the beginning.\n\nDr. Wahls is one of several diets touted online, including swank. Each of these diets come with similar testimonials that people swear by. Yet, they all oppose one another. Should we do high fat paleo like wahls? Low fat like swank? Should we go vegan like some propose? Isn‚Äôt that at odds with both Swank and Wahls? Gluten or no? I do not believe any diet is a miracle cure for MS. \n\nRemyelination- I do not believe any particular diet can aid in this. BUT I do believe it is aided by not having an active attack. The best way to reduce attacks is to get on a DMD/DMT. I‚Äôll touch on this later.\n\nWhat I think we can do to help our chances/delay progression:\n- Maintain a healthy diet. I monitor my caloric intake. I do not avoid gluten, dairy, eggs, or anything really\n- Exercise - 30 minutes three times a week\n- Start Treatment - ASAP! I would start with a big gun but there are divergent schools of thought (Escalation vs. Induction)\n\nOn a personal note - I did wahls for a few months and had another relapse. I realize that‚Äôs anecdotal, but so are all of the testimonials. There have not been enough studies on the various diets to recommend them.\n\nSomething that I wish I had seen earlier is doctor Aaron bosters youtube channel. He‚Äôs the best resource available. \n\nHope it didn‚Äôt seem like I was being critical of you or anything.

i6kkews,ue2873,"You‚Äôre going to get various opinions on these questions. Every person is different and has different beliefs about MS and how to treat it. Some things work for some, but doesn‚Äôt work for others. Lots of trial and error. Take the below with a grain of salt. This is only my non-doctor opinions and what I‚Äôve personally experienced.\n \n1) My rule of thumb (take it or leave it) is do your best to eat ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and exercise, if possible. Even if that means a 30 min walk a day. Any sort of exercise you can. Just move your body. And not everyone can do 100% clean eating. So I do what I can. I swap out for a healthy option if possible and cut down sugar as much as I can. Some people will say eating healthy and exercise has changed their life immensely for the better, some will say it doesn‚Äôt help at all. It‚Äôs trial and error for each person unfortunately. \n  \n2) Swimming helps me in the summer months bc of my heat intolerance. Hot baths/showers/hot tub = no no no for me. \n \n3) My personal suggestion (again take it or leave it) is to start a DMT immediately to prevent further progression or more lesions. \n \n4) Do your best to avoid getting sick or super high stress situations. It‚Äôs inevitable that you will get sick and you will get stressed but doing your best to prevent both will help with additional flares or pseudo-flares. \n \n5) Rest when you need to rest. So no push yourself to do more than you can. I used to push myself all the time and learned the hard way that pushing yourself only results in a pseudo-flare of old symptoms and fatigue attacks. This is my personal experience. \n  \nGood luck! I‚Äôm also still learning and I‚Äôm 2+ years into my diagnosis.

i6jqrbm,udwxwe,"Below is some advice I have someone recently in a similar position looking to make their home more MS friendly. \n\nMS is different for everyone but here are Some general tips from me (41M 4 years diagnosed) \n\n-Hardwood floors and tiles are tricky, both from a balance/slipping perspective and also getting cold feet. If you have them think about rugs or get him good warm slippers when he‚Äôs walking. \n-MS gave me ADHD too FYI so he might develop that too so it‚Äôs good you are aware of that. Adderall is a life saver for me, helps fatigue and concentration. \n-if you don‚Äôt have a disabled shower then try and get a bench fitted or at the very least add grip to the floor of the tub and shower. \n- make sure all stair cases are not slippery and have hand rails. \n-sometimes getting in and out of chairs is hard. Maybe check with him if they are too soft or if he struggles to get out them. \n-similar with beds. Too high? Too low? Just check. \n-my memory is awful, his will likely suffer too. Maybe a chalk board or something in the house to make note of chores or tasks for the day. Or if you leave a message. Forgetting things is a horrible reminder you have MS, it can make you feel bad when you forget something and let people down. Helping avoid that could be good. \n-diet, lots of different advice out there for eating. Play around with different food options and see what helps. No gluten. Low salt, vegan etc. It may or may not help but is worth trying. \n- physical therapy has reeeaaly helped me. If he‚Äôs not going to regular sessions think about some products for an at home gym area. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a lot of money. Some rubber band body weight exercise will help loads. Maybe a balance board. Those can be cost effective. I can‚Äôt stress how much this helped me. \n- I often have cognitive issues where my brain just shuts down. I can‚Äôt answer a simple question, often when it‚Äôs making a choice. It‚Äôs literally impossible and that‚Äôs frustrating. Especially when it‚Äôs ‚Äústill of sparking water‚Äù or something silly like that. Explain to him that‚Äôs ok if that happens and he can just say ‚Äúpass‚Äù or something to explain he just can‚Äôt answer right now. \n- mental health issues are a bit problem. Be open with him, let him know he can share with you or get a therapist or medication if needed. It‚Äôs hard to take action yourself when you are depressed so if you can be there for him and encourage him that could help. As a guy I found this initial reaching out for help hard. Still some stigma around mental health and guys can be dumb about getting any kind of help. You have a broken leg you see a doctor, broken brain same thing. \n-stress is a big trigger for me. It makes everything worse. Speak to him to make sure you are on the same page about what causes him stress at home. And be open minded if it‚Äôs something that seems dumb to you. I pretty much have a breakdown whenever I have to open mail hahaha. Don‚Äôt know why but I do. Offer to help whee you can. \n-encourage him to find other MS patients the same age and join support groups. The first one I went to I was terrified because lots of people were much older and had very advanced MS and it freaked me out seeing what I thought my future might look like. \n\nAlso, not house related but be sure to get him on a good DMT disease modifying therapy asap. Like Ocrevus, don‚Äôt let doctors try and start you on lesser medications. Insist on the best treatment immediately, if the doctor won‚Äôt back you get a new Neurologist. MS damage can‚Äôt be Repaired so you have to stop the damage getting worse asap. \nYou or he can reach out to me anytime via PM if you need anything. \nGood luck, MS sucks but with the right management and some lifestyle changes you can still lead a great life. Make sure he realizes it‚Äôs not the end of the world, just the beginning of a slightly different one.",1651161771,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6jqrbm/
i6jj2w8,udwxwe,Be by his side at the wedding. And the rest of your lives.\n\nHaving a strong loving caregiver is the best thing you can do for him. You are correct. This is a lonely battle.

By the way you write, it seems like you don't know much about him and his disease. You should change that. It sucks you've waited until 2 months before your marriage to want to know, but here you are. \n\nYou have your own homework to do, and it doesn't start here.; It starts with him. Talk to your fianc√© and find out how he wants to communicate with you. We can all pontificate and tell you fluffy things, but he knows himself and you know how you'll react to him. \n\nUse your words and talk to him. Good luck on your marriage and I do wish you luck in talking with him.",1651162288,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6js1hu/
i6jszt1,udwxwe,"The best thing that my now-husband did for me when I was diagnosed was to ensure me that, no matter what happens, he will be by my side. Make sure your fiance knows that as well, and remind him of that when things get tough.\n\nAlways keep in mind that he has MS and how it could affect the future. For example, when my husband and I were looking to buy our first house, we went to a couple before he said, ""maybe we should think about having a bedroom on the first floor in case it's hard to get upstairs sometimes."" He was absolutely right. I am so thankful we bought a 1.5 story house for that reason. \n\nNever compare what he feels to how you feel/have felt. If you read posts on here, you'll see many MSers upset because someone said ""oh, I'm tired too"" or ""a nap always makes me feel better."" Unless you have a disorder that gives you chronic fatigue, your tiredness is not comparable to MS fatigue. When your fiance doesn't feel up to going out with friends, or being outside in the heat, etc. understand that he has a legitimate reason and don't second-guess him. My husband knows that, if we have a really busy day, the next day I'll need to take it easy and he'll be in charge of our kiddo that day. I'd recommend looking up ""the spoon theory story.""\n\nAs for eating better/exercising, that's something everyone should do, and even more important for those with MS! That being said, don't push him to do anything. Try to make it fun and find and cook healthy meals together and workout together or get into doing nightly walks or bike rides (if he's able.) \n\nIt's so sweet that you're on here trying to help your fiance- he's certainly a lucky guy. Congrats on your engagement!",1651162680,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6jszt1/
i6kgu15,udwxwe,"My husband has MS, so I am in a very similar situation to you.\n\nUsually I let my husband be the one to be in charge of his care. If he needs my help, he knows that I will do my best to do what he needs at that time.\n\nHere are some examples of when I needed to help. My husband was prescribed some medication to help his nerve pain, but unfortunately he was reacting very, very badly to it. It was one of those medications that you can't just stop taking, so I made sure I was available to go to his next doctor appointment with him to discuss (I don't usually go). I made sure the doctor knew that my husband was having serious anger outbursts and asked if he could stop taking it, and the doctor understood that it was pretty serious since I don't usually even go to his appointments.  He was able to slowly take him off the medication.\n\nSometimes I also go to his appointments if he wants extra support, like for his first few MRIs and for some infusions he needed a while back (this is something that is rarely needed, but sometimes it can happen. He has only ever needed an infusion once (but two separate times, if that makes sense)). He doesn't want me to go anymore, though, because it's just a lot of sitting around waiting for him to be finished.\n\nYou don't want to dictate his care, he should be the one in charge of decisions. But being there to help when he needs support is what works for us.\n\nHopefully this helps!",1651172262,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6kgu15/
i6jj54n,udwxwe,I think everyone is different in the way he or she wants to get treated while having any disease.\n\nIn my case I just want to be treated like everyone else and forget about the MS for most of the time. For me it is just enough to have a normal relationship with nice talks to look forward to.\n\nI can't really help you in terms of exercise or other daily tips because those were never points that changed anything for me in the way I viewed my life with MS.,1651158669,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6jj54n/
i6kivql,udwxwe,"The first thing I can say is that the most meaningful thing a partner could do for me is treat me like I don‚Äôt have MS. It is something that we will have to deal with forever, but I don‚Äôt think it needs to be a focal part of any relationship. Now, if his condition is far worse than mine, I could see it being different.. but yeah. I‚Äôm not sure how comfortable he feels about having it, but it causes a lot of self-consciousness in myself. If I had a girlfriend or wife, I would just want her to be understanding when I really feel like I can‚Äôt do something, and would want her to encourage me to eat healthier and have an active lifestyle. It would be ideal if she wanted to do those sorts of things with me as well. In my opinion, this is the most important thing a partner could do for me while making me feel comfortable. My last girlfriend was very accepting but didn‚Äôt want to be healthier with me. This lead to a decline in my condition because I didn‚Äôt have the willpower to do it by myself sometimes and it made me feel physically worse. This then contributed to fatigue, irritation, and other things. \n\nSome things that have personally helped my conditions are eating less processed foods, avoiding alcohol, exercising lightly everyday with more intensive exercise throughout the week, and staying hydrated. I think many of us don‚Äôt want to feel like we are disabled or defective. Even though people mean well, when they try and fix things, it can make us feel like we are. I really think the best thing you can do is to encourage a lifestyle that would benefit you both and be something that you two can do and enjoy together.",1651173083,t3_udwxwe,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6kivql/

Weddings are stressful and stress brings out symptoms, so if he's overloaded, he may just have problems working with details. Don't add to the stress- be okay with letting things go a little bit.\n\nOh, and lecturing about yet another quack diet/exercise/treatment will probably not help. At least in the short term.

Seeing as OP‚Äôs fianc√© was diagnosed years prior, hopefully they have a good course of treatment laid out already. But it never hurts to get another opinion from a neurologist who specializes in MS and see if they know of any clinical trials or more current courses of treatment they would recommend to slow or halt the progression. Get as much medical advice as possible, research the potential options laid out for him, talk with him about it, try to eat healthy with him, and just be there to support however he wants to address it. He may not want to change anything so be open to however he wants to proceed, at least initially. If you‚Äôre ever concerned about how he‚Äôs handling his condition you can address that with him later. Also, I recommend looking into anti-inflammatory diets.

i6mu3pw,udwxwe,Not sure how long you had MS for the_innernette. It's good that your positive about a cure in this decade. There's allot involved in a cure. They first need to figure out what causes MS. Then figure out something to eliminate it. Then they have to figure out how to repair the destroyed mylein sheath and the axon nerves the mylein sheath protects. Then the black holes in the brain and spine from lesions. There's alot involved with this. Just can't get a shot and your cured and 100 percent normal healthy and functional. And let's not forget what big pharma has invested in current medications. Just in America alone big pharma makes well  over  2 billion a year in MS medications. Trust me they will have a say. I believe better medications will continue to come out. Hopefully they come out with a medication that's halts progression by 95% for all MS people. That will probably be another 12-15 years with FDA red tape and other stuff that pops up. Reality is there's no money in cures. There's only money in more and more medications,1651211692,t1_i6moxm9,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/udwxwe/my_fianc√©_has_ms_i_want_to_help_him_get_better/i6mu3pw/

It seemed, at least, like they took it seriously as compared to (most of) the US. \n\nFor context, I was also on Ocrevus and triple-vaxxed (April/June/September 2021 per my Impfpass). As the primary caretaker for my family, I HAD to leave the house and use public transport to do the food shopping, take my children to appointments, etc. Once the pubs reopened, I HAD to visit weekly or biweekly, for mental health reasons, as that was the extent of the social life I'd been able to create in the couple of months before the first lockdown started.\n\nWhen I did catch Covid in early January 2022, I had fevers and bone aches for about 4 days (very traditionally flu-like), and then was extremely fatigued for about 3-4 weeks. A lot like when I had mononucleosis back in high school, actually, except with a PCR to confirm Covid.\n\nIt's all about finding the risk-benefit ratio that you're comfortable with. Life is for living, and risks are for mitigating. Choose the things you want to do, choose the amount of protection you want, and feel confident that you -- not MS or Covid -- has made the best choice for you. If the anxiety is really bothersome or lasting longer than you think it should, you can treat the anxiety like any other health issue (psychotherapy, medication, magnesium, gentle exercise, more rest, etc).\n\nI wish you peace and luck!",1651106660,t3_uddwgn,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uddwgn/still_scared_from_covid/i6h2lme/

I had MS for at least a decade before that but it went undiagnosed.  Since 2016, I've had a myriad of symptoms, some transient, some permanent, some that make me question if I have a cardiac problem, but in the end I end up pinning them all on MS (again, rightly or wrongly) because the reality is that it is almost impossible to determine which symtpoms are being caused by MS damage within the brain and which are not. It's easier to diagnose a cause and effect with spinal cord damage caused by MS.\n\nI don't have any good advice for you except to keep asking your doctors what else could cause a particular symptom and then hopefully, there is a test for that.

i6cxnzh,ucpp0e,"I‚Äôm a 51 year old man and I‚Äôve been living with MS for 25 years. As others have stated, it‚Äôs an unpredictable disease and everyone experiences it somewhat differently.\n\nI was devastated and terrified at the time of diagnosis. I had lost feeling from my neck to my feet over the span of 24 hours. And it took many months for those initial symptoms to subside. \n\nBut i haven‚Äôt let it slow me down. I‚Äôve made a great life for myself in spite of this disease.\n\nI have a fantastic job, an incredible wife and 2 wonderful kids. MS forced me to reevaluate my career path and other life choices but despite the issues it‚Äôs caused me, it has not ‚Äúblown up my life‚Äù like I assumed it would back in 1997.\n\nFor the first 15 years, I had Relapsing Remitting MS. I would get flares/attacks seemingly at random times. I probably had 8‚Äì12 of these during those 15 years. Each was different but usually involved significant numbness in one more parts of my body. Once, I experienced vision issues, but my symptoms always vanished after a few days or few weeks. I experienced significant fatigue at times, heat sensitivity, brain fog, and most of the common things you‚Äôll read and hear about during that time.\n\nThe past ten years however, have been different. I experienced my last flare in 2012. It was a major flare, however. I got extreme numbness in my right leg and right hand. And I also started having bladder issues. Per usual, the numbness started to subside after a few weeks, however this time it never fully went away. I was now transitioning to Secondary Progressive MS.\n\nSince then, the numbness has slowly intensified in my hand and forearm over the years. I have trouble writing, but oddly typing is mostly okay. It‚Äôs weird and difficult to explain. My leg numbness is now leg weakness. I walk with a limp. I now have an AFO (Ankle Foot Orthodic) that helps me and I‚Äôll probably need to start using a cane at some point in the not too distant future.\n\nBoth of my feet are very numb now. And I have a neurogenic bladder. The bladder issues are not great and it was a difficult transition for me mentally initially, but it‚Äôs a non-issue now and has had very little impact on my life.\n\nAt this point none of these symptoms will go away and they are slowly getting worse. But emphasis on ‚Äúslowly.‚Äù \n\nOddly, once I transitioned to SPMS, I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm not really heat sensitive anymore. And I rarely get brain fog. I also don‚Äôt get suddenly fatigued like I used to. I guess that‚Äôs the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù.\n\nMy advice‚Äî don‚Äôt tell people unless you absolutely have to. In my experience, very little good comes from it. Assuming you have RRMS, your symptoms will come and go and most people won‚Äôt be able to tell. I would definitely discourage him from ever telling people at work. Even if you have a supportive boss and coworkers, divulging his MS could negatively impact his chance for advancement and promotion.\n\nI‚Äôve been on Ocrevus since 2017. Over the years I‚Äôve taken Avonex, Rebif, and Gilenya.\n\nThis is a scary time for you and your husband. But MS doesn‚Äôt mean that his hopes and dreams are out of reach.

i6c4cm0,ucpp0e,"I remember those first days. It was scary not knowing anything. And back then, 1998, doctors didn't know as much as they know today. I was late 30s, two small girls, and I thought I had my whole career ahead of me.\n\nSo I decided that I was not going to let this beat me. I got on the internet, which at that time was still kind of new, and I tried to find out everything I could about this b**** disease. I had too much to live for and I was not going to let something like this get in my way. Once I found out that MS was not fatal, I knew I had a fighting chance. I knew I could do things to make this disease more tolerable.\n\nMake sure you have a good MS neurologist. General neurologists are okay, but he has a special disease so you need a special doctor. Listen to the doctor, he knows what's right for him. Listen to everything he says. And most of all listen to your body. It now knows what you can and cannot do. Don't try to be Superman thinking you can beat this. MS is not curable. But science can give you a way to live.\n\nYou can plan for the future, but in the beginning here you can only plan day by day. When your husband feels stronger, then you can take bigger steps into the future. But make sure you set realistic goals, things that you can achieve. Both him by himself and you all as a family. And you're going to have failures. It's only normal. Learn from them, grow from them.

i670p8c,ubtv0i,"USA\n\n  \nI have a very unusual situation that arises of having a good employer, insider healthcare information, good planning, and a fair portion of luck.  I pay about $560 per month in premiums for my workplace sponsored health insurance.  It is a high deductible plan with a $7000 deductible each for me and my wife. After that deductible is met, 100% of the cost of anything that is a normal covered service is paid by my insurance company.  Because my employer wants to keep costs down, but is sensitive to employee needs, they added an additional benefit to help with deductibles.  Essentially, 50% of the deductible cost is reimbursed as I incur those costs.  My Ocrevus infusion bills at about $87000 every 6 months, and I have a copay assistance program from Genentech that covers almost all of my portion of that.  Because the provider bills my insurance first, they identify $7000 as my cost, and then pay $30000 for the ""contractually allowed amount"" for my infusion.  The $7000 (or almost the whole amount) is paid by the drug manufacturer.  The insurance billing triggers the employer's reimbursement amount and therefore sends me about $3500.

This means its limited to only a small percentage on your income, even at minimum wage it's only about 9/10% of your monthly income for broad cover plans in most of europe and can be further reduced if you choose a higher out of pocket amount if you're confident you won't need it that year.",1650961155,t1_i673b8m,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubtv0i/i_was_wondering_about_what_ms_costs_you_in_your/i68pb92/

This will make it easier in the future if you seek a second opinion.\n\nMy diagnosis occurred after a relapse that gave me pins and needles and numbness from my toes to my waist. I had IV steroids for 5 days in a hospital, and fully recovered to normal about 2 and a half months later. I started on Kesimpta soon after.\n\nI lost motor control in my right wrist in march - it impacted typing, and handwriting. It really brought me down mentally. I could ignore my feet being tingly if I sat down, but how do you ignore your dominant hand not responding well? An MRI revealed a new active lesion in the left side of my brain. I said no to steroids, and it recovered after 3 weeks (about 1 week after my 1st maintenance dose of Kesimpta).\n\nMS is a lot to take in. There's a ton of information out there, but an MS specialist will be the best person to talk to.

i656ap7,ubk27y,"I speak as a healthcare financial consultant with more exposure to the inner workings of insurance billing and payments than most people have.  \n\n\nThe ""brand"" of insurance is essentially irrelevant. The plan will be very different from one choice to the next.  Most high deductible plans have better coverage after that deductible is met than other plans do. If you are on a DMT it is possible that you may have access to a copay assistance program.  That may have the net result of paying for your deductible so that you do not pay out of pocket.  \nYou need to familiarize yourself with the terms:  \n\- Deductible  \n\- Copay / Coinsurance  \n\- Out of Pocket Maximum  \n\- Annual maximum benefit  \n\- Lifetime maximum benefit  \nA plan that seems very favorable otherwise may have a maximum that they pay each year or for your lifetime, meaning that once your total medical bills exceed that number, you are personally responsible for every dollar after that.  High deductible plans usually have a high or unlimited lifetime benefit amount. For my exact situation I have a high deductible plan, and HSA that I opened myself and fund with after tax dollars for a tax deduction, and copay assistance for Ocrevus infusions.  My Ocrevus is scheduled for the start of the plan year so that I can have that be the first thing that hits my insurance for the year, meaning that insurance applies that cost to my deductible and the copay assistance pays almost every dollar of that.  The rest of my medical costs are covered 100%.  My wife incurs some deductible related costs each year, but usually hits the annual out-of-pocket maximum early in the year. My Ocrevus infusion is billed at about $87K per visit.  My insurance has an contracted amount that reduces that to $37K.  The deductible is $7K.  So the first infusion has insurance say that $7k is my share, which then gets paid by copay assistance from Genentech. My insurance pays the $30K remaining.   \nWhen you compare plans, add up the cost of premiums as well as the amounts that you are likely to pay in deductibles and coinsurance amounts for the year. If you are able to have an FSA or an HSA/MSA you will likely benefit from choosing to utilize one of these options.  \nAnyone on this sub should feel welcome to message me directly if you have other USA insurance questions.

If you were going to research something, I would suggest the following: (1) do your pharmacy expenses count towards your medical deductible and out of pocket (you want them to be pooled and count for both), (2) does the plan‚Äôs network include the neurologist you want to see, and (3) does your pharmacy benefit require prior authorization and or ‚Äústep therapy‚Äù for the DMT that you are on or want to be on.",1650901089,t3_ubk27y,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubk27y/what_insurances_is_the_best_when_you_have_ms/i654h5m/

i69mkq5,ube677,"To put this in perspective:  my first symptoms (right-side facial paralysis, including complete inability to shut my eye; right-sided neck, shoulder and arm spasms; and right-sided MS hug) were in 1986, when I was 22. The honest-to-God medical training at that time was that MS was a disease of people in their 40s, not someone in their 20s. I lived in the 2nd largest city in my state, and even it did not get an MRI machine until 7 years later, in 1993. \n\nAfter my diagnosis in 2009, my small city did have an MS support group, run by the National MS Society.  When the National MS Society pulled out of my state (South Dakota) in 2011 or so, an egomaniac -- whom the MS Society had basically kicked out of meetings, because he was so awful -- returned to the support group and took over the meetings, allowing no one else to speak. Didn't take long until everyone just stopped coming.\n\nIn my opinion, the National MS Society left us high and dry when it made a ""regional"" office that is a 6-hour drive away.  But that is the trend; fewer physical offices mean more ~~profits~~ \-- oops, my bad.  I mean, ""the donations can stretch farther to help more people.""

i63kyhl,ubdnoj,"I am sorry you're having a difficult time with all of this. Trust me I have been there myself all too often. What I can say however is that you know your body better than anyone else. When you say something is off, it's off and something needs to be done. You have more than enough evidence to suggest that the tests that you'd like completed are necessary. You shouldn't even need to advocate to that degree but I understand that is often the case sadly. Get every test. When I was first diagnosed it took 3 trips to the ER before someone would listen to me and give me an MRI. \n\nYou are the most important person on your team, you're going to feel like an asshole for pushing so hard, but trust me it's better to push through it being uncomfortable and awkward and move towards managing and healing than let someone that isn't listening to you dictate your condition and inevitably delay any progress towards feeling better. \n\nGood luck and I hope you get what you need <3",1650867509,t3_ubdnoj,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubdnoj/tltr_seeking_advice_on_advocating_for_my_health/i63kyhl/

i6czl9e,ubdnoj,"Hi lilbird22!\n\nFirst off, I just want to say thank you for your support and everything you wrote. I appreciate your kind words and relatability to my situation. That's so true that we know our body better than anyone else and know when something is off, thank you. I've read so many stories of the struggles people have gone through to be taken seriously, listened to, and to finally have their diagnoses after pushing hard for themselves. I feel for everyone who has to push harder than they should have to get help and I understand the frustration.\n\nEven though you had to go to the ER multiple times, I'm so glad to hear that they finally gave you a MRI. Was it that MRI from the ER that they found something or did you have to have more testing done to find out what's going on? I've been to the ER 5 times and everytime they didn't care that I was suffering in front of them and wrote me anti-anxiety medicine. They never ever have taken me seriously and because of my history of anxiety they think it's anxiety and I tell them it's not and I explain to them why I know that, and they look at me like I'm crazy. I've also had paramedics come to my house a few times and my family and I know I was having seizures before I saw a neurologist, and they also said I wasn't having a seizure right in front of them, ""it's anxiety"". I had to pull over one morning before I couldn't work anymore and called a close coworker of mine for help. I notified my coworker that I called 911 and pulled over before getting on the main road because I was about to pass out...It was hard to breathe, I was extremely dizzy, having a hard time getting words out, and felt like I was leaving my body...I didn't work for a few days. I absolutely dread going to the ER because I know they will write me off no matter what I say or do and if I have another big seizure, I would refuse if I could. I had a huge seizure at work last year and would have smashed my head multiple times on the hard floor if multiple people weren't there to secure me...a coworker took a video of it too. After I was put in the ambulance, I couldn't answer the paramedics simple questions like where I was and my birthdate, I couldn't think and was very confused. Before and after that time, I've had seizures occasionally, but not as severe and I try not to worry myself about having another big one because my body gives me warning signs even seconds beforehand.\n\nYou're so right about being the most important person on my team and pushing through the negative to heal and make progress. Yeah, I'm tired of giving so much energy and time to doctors hoping that he or she will be the one to finally listen to me and care, but I don't want to give up because things won't get better for me. I appreciate what you said that pushing hard through no matter what is better than letting others dictate my condition and delaying progress to get better. Thank you...your message has made me feel more encouraged than I have in awhile to not give up and push forward for healing. \n\nI was supposed to see a new neurologist tomorrow and they canceled on me today. I called their office and they said that the neurologist was looking at my chart and said that she doesn't specialize in seizure history and wanted me to see a different one. I told the office that I'm sad and frustrated to be notified by this last minute because I've been waiting for this appointment for two months and would have booked an appointment with the other neurologist a long time ago. I called the other neurology office that they referred me to today a few times and left a message, but I wasn't able to connect with someone. I will not give up and see who will help me or not. Thank you for believing in me and you're supportive message. People in my life have weaponized my shortcomings and health to hurt me so I've gotten used to not opening up and putting up guards to protect myself from everyone, except my aunt and bf. I'm glad to know who I can't share personal details anymore with and I'm thankful to have posted here because I feel less alone. I mean reading posts on here often has already helped me to feel less alone already.\n\nI'm curious and want to ask if you deal with neck pain/soreness that makes it hard to stay asleep? Lately my neck has been giving me trouble and it's uncomfortable to stay asleep now and I keep having to shift in bed. Is neck pain/uncomfortable feelings in the neck something that MS or other disorders may cause in your opinion? It's yet another thing I'll bring up to the neurologist. \n\nI hope you have a fantastic week and it was a pleasure talking with you!! :3",1651032471,t1_i63kyhl,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubdnoj/tltr_seeking_advice_on_advocating_for_my_health/i6czl9e/
i63jarq,ubd5tw,"I would see the 2nd neuro.. but I would not directly ask for tests. IME (I had a mentally ill mother who was a hypochondriac), drs sorta get shifty when people request extra specific types of tests like lumbar punctures and EP tests... it begins to look like the patient has been spending too much time online trying to self diagnose on WebMD... also, ordering testing based on patient request vs professional opinion opens them up for SERIOUSLY heavy scrutiny with regard to overbilling/insurance scamming. \n\nIf you want to ask about these types of tests, do it in a way that is going to introduce it to the doctor's thoughts by asking their opinion vs directly asking for them.\nAlso, and this is awful to have to say, but I wouldn't mention any of your previous struggles with mental health.. Unfortunately, it can be a red flag for doctors, and is not relevant to your current problems, so there is no need for the new doctor to have that info unless it becomes relevant at some point.\n\nMaybe try making a list of your symptoms to give the second neuro thats perhaps not as wordy.. you will have the opportunity to elaborate at your appt but as descriptively as it is typed its extremely overwhelming.\n\nAlthough your parts of the exchange you copy/pasted are very courteous and professional-- and I'm not trying to sound like an ass by saying this-- to me, it does come off as sounding extremely anxious and to someone not directly experiencing the symptoms, that anxiety can read as desperation and to a doctor, desperation mixed with online symptom checking often spells hysteria and an issue with one's mental health, which can make them more dismissive.\n\nToo often our problems get swept under the rug because of this logic, and then it can be too late. My mother (who was indeed a hypochondriac throughout her entire life-- she even had a totally unnecessary full-on BRAIN SURGERY when I was a kid before they started screening better for this behavior) ended up dx'd with stg 4 cancer, and I feel that it could've been caught earlier if her interactions with her new doctor hadn't shouted through the roof that she was mentally ill.",1650866320,t3_ubd5tw,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubd5tw/seeking_advice_on_advocating_for_my_health/i63jarq/

i64juhq,ubbq2q,"Firstly well done for being so supportive and helpful to your brother! ‚ù§Ô∏è \nMS is different for everyone but here are Some general tips from me (41M 4 years diagnosed) \n\n-Hardwood floors and tiles are tricky, both from a balance/slipping perspective and also getting cold feet. If you have them think about rugs or get him good warm slippers when he‚Äôs walking. \n-MS gave me ADHD too FYI so he might develop that too so it‚Äôs good you are aware of that. Adderall is a life saver for me, helps fatigue and concentration. \n-if you don‚Äôt have a disabled shower then try and get a bench fitted or at the very least add grip to the floor of the tub and shower. \n- make sure all stair cases are not slippery and have hand rails. \n-sometimes getting in and out of chairs is hard. Maybe check with him if they are too soft or if he struggles to get out them. \n-similar with beds. Too high? Too low? Just check. \n-my memory is awful, his will likely suffer too. Maybe a chalk board or something in the house to make note of chores or tasks for the day. Or if you leave a message. Forgetting things is a horrible reminder you have MS, it can make you feel bad when you forget something and let people down. Helping avoid that could be good. \n-diet, lots of different advice out there for eating. Play around with different food options and see what helps. No gluten. Low salt, vegan etc. It may or may not help but is worth trying. \n- physical therapy has reeeaaly helped me. If he‚Äôs not going to regular sessions think about some products for an at home gym area. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a lot of money. Some rubber band body weight exercise will help loads. Maybe a balance board. Those can be cost effective. I can‚Äôt stress how much this helped me. \n- I often have cognitive issues where my brain just shuts down. I can‚Äôt answer a simple question, often when it‚Äôs making a choice. It‚Äôs literally impossible and that‚Äôs frustrating. Especially when it‚Äôs ‚Äústill of sparking water‚Äù or something silly like that. Explain to him that‚Äôs ok if that happens and he can just say ‚Äúpass‚Äù or something to explain he just can‚Äôt answer right now. \n- mental health issues are a bit problem. Be open with him, let him know he can share with you or get a therapist or medication if needed. It‚Äôs hard to take action yourself when you are depressed so if you can be there for him and encourage him that could help. As a guy I found this initial reaching out for help hard. Still some stigma around mental health and guys can be dumb about getting any kind of help. You have a broken leg you see a doctor, broken brain same thing. \n-stress is a big trigger for me. It makes everything worse. Speak to him to make sure you are on the same page about what causes him stress at home. And be open minded if it‚Äôs something that seems dumb to you. I pretty much have a breakdown whenever I have to open mail hahaha. Don‚Äôt know why but I do. Offer to help whee you can. \n-encourage him to find other MS patients the same age and join support groups. The first one I went to I was terrified because lots of people were much older and had very advanced MS and it freaked me out seeing what I thought my future might look like. \n\nAlso, not house related but be sure to get him on a good DMT disease modifying therapy asap. Like Ocrevus, don‚Äôt let doctors try and start you on lesser medications. Insist on the best treatment immediately, if the doctor won‚Äôt back you get a new Neurologist. MS damage can‚Äôt be Repaired so you have to stop the damage getting worse asap. \nYou or he can reach out to me anytime via PM if you need anything. \nGood luck, MS sucks but with the right management and some lifestyle changes you can still lead a great life. Make sure he realizes it‚Äôs not the end of the world, just the beginning of a slightly different one.",1650892390,t3_ubbq2q,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubbq2q/helping_my_brother/i64juhq/

The reason for this: she likely had no access/very limited access to DMT‚Äôs (disease modifying therapy) to try and slow down her progression.  DMT‚Äôs work like birth control - their aim is to prevent any more brain/spinal cord damage.  Unfortunately, we still don‚Äôt have any treatments for damage (lesions) that are already there. \n\nThe *very first* MS DMT only came out in the mid-90‚Äôs. It was very difficult to even get it, as there was limited supply (they literally did a lottery and only allowed those who were doing the worst to enter the lottery).  Furthermore, it was not very effective.  Today, we have highly effective DMT‚Äôs that basically stop MS in its tracks, and attitudes in the MS neurology community have swung to getting newly diagnosed people on highly effective DMTs right away.  The more damage that can be prevented now, the better your quality of life will be 20/40/60 years from now.

So while you may have an active lesion (that would be considered 1 issue), you may still need to wait for something else to happen. Even if you show other lesions (I had 2 others on my first MRI), they may be non-specific and the radiologist may not think their MS like enough to chalk it up to that. \n\nMy first MRI for optic neuritis showed my active optic nerve inflammation and 2 non-specific lesions they thought could be strokes.

i61mewo,ub1qln,"Hi! I was diagnosed at the same age. \n\nThe general consensus on this subreddit (and most top MS doctors and practitioners) is to hit the disease hard and fast. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to scare you, but MS damage is typically cumulative - even if you have relapsing remitting which is the most common type. \n\nWhat happens is you start at 0. When you relapse, symptoms get bad, and then they back off or lessen, but you won‚Äôt likely go back to your ‚Äúlevel 0.‚Äù It might not be .5\n\nMy left arm is still weak and I have weird neuropathy in it from 2017. \n\nAs far as medication goes, they all have an ‚Äúefficacy‚Äù rating. The efficacy of the drug is the rate at which it slows progression or diminishes relapse rate. To explain: if you ‚Äúnormally‚Äù have 3 relapses a year, a drug with an efficacy of 30% (of which glatect is around there) would mean it should reduce your relapse by 1/3. So 2 relapses a year would still count as glatect ‚Äúworking‚Äù if that makes sense.\n\nNow the goal with a DMT is to have NO Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA). This means in the form of a relapse, or changes in an MRI. MOST neurologists would not say that you having relapses on glatect (or any drug) is good, and would likely ask you to switch after that first relapse. \n\nThe kicker here is that you may already have some permanent damage from that first relapse on a lower efficacy drug while they waited for it to fail. \n\nMy MS clinic follows a ‚Äúfail up‚Äù model, and it‚Äôs bad. We are offered first line therapies like glatect and other injectables, and once we fail (which is the drug failing, not you) they move to the next step and so forth. \n\nThe reason this sub and highly regarded neuros suggest the hard and fast is to not let that damage accumulate in the first place. There is a trade off in terms of risks, and you will likely have more monitoring on the better drugs‚Ä¶but they are better. \n\nI will also say anecdotally - I AM on glatect currently. Have been since beginning of November 2020. It‚Äôs the only safe drug while trying to conceive/pregnant‚Ä¶.and I HATE it. The monthly monitoring I had on Tecfidera, or every 3 months on Gilenya were nothing compared to the daily injections. I would do blood once a week to not have to deal with these injections. It‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs experience, but I have terrible site reactions, huge bruising and overall it‚Äôs just awful. I‚Äôm choosing to stay on it as my MS was fairly active before trying to conceive and some protection is better than nothing in my opinion.\n\nYou will also find many people who have been on an injectable therapy for a long time and are happy with it, but overall this sub will encourage something stronger like Ocrevus or Tysabri.\n\n(Sorry if this is all over the place. MS brain and baby brain are real, and I‚Äôm typing on my phone üòõ)",1650832540,t3_ub1qln,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ub1qln/is_glatect_a_good_medication/i61mewo/

i61mrqd,ub1qln,Forgot to add - glatect is the generic version of copaxone. Copaxone was one of the first ever(if not the first) MS medications so they have lots of data about the medication.

I‚Äôm a little frustrated because I feel like they gave me no information on efficacy or on stronger medications. I want to be on the best medication because I definitely think it‚Äôs better to prevent that damage rather than wait for it to happen‚Ä¶ \n\nI also get site reactions, sometimes I get really big bruises and sometimes it‚Äôs fine.

i61hxdc,ub0h6j,"You aren't going to figure that out. MS is complex. Many many people have had childhood trauma and they don't have MS. The ones you listed above probably apply to the majority of the population. The divorce rate is over 50%, and many kids get bullied these days. So you are talking about nearly everyone to some extent. Trauma is also very subjective. Some people experience what someone else might consider minor stress but it could be very stressful to them, and the opposite is true as well. Most therapists across the world work with people that have had childhood trauma and a tiny percentage of them are MS patients. \n\nChildhood trauma can also result in other behaviors -  poor diet for example. People that are in traumatic situations sometimes don't get the care they need in terms of exercise, sunlight, etc. Even if you made some conclusion that ""childhood trauma"" played a part in causing your MS, it might not be the trauma itself but the environment surrounding it. \n\nBut there are many factors that cause MS and nobody knows what makes someone for sure get it vs. someone else. EBV is a definite trigger. There is a genetic component. Low levels of vitamin D. There could be a multitude of other factors that, when combined, cause MS. \n\nYou should focus on treatment and lifestyle changes at this point in time. There is no point in speculating about something so incredibly vague when there are so many other factors at play.

In my case I was diagnosed at 16, and everything has stayed almost the same since we caught it but I still had the ocular degeneration and now legally blind. \n\nSo there may still be areas that deal with the autoimmune response, that could lead to disability but its different for everyone. Also keep your eye out for any secondary conditions MS may create. (If you're JC positive and medicated, you need to keep an eye on that too because that can be a real quick death).",1650820231,t1_i60n3p2,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uay82v/mild_to_moderate/i60sto4/

i616kvm,uaxcg7,"I‚Äôd been dating my girlfriend for a few years when she was diagnosed with MS. And, as much as I hate to admit it, I too would wonder why she mightn‚Äôt allow for certain accommodations, but other times wonder why she wouldn‚Äôt just accept she was unable to something rather than put herself through the stress of trying. It was a learning curve for us both. She was navigating a disease that would significantly alter her life and I too was navigating those same waters, albeit from a distance.\n\nWhat helped was to talk about, but REALLY talk about it. Have some conversations that may be uncomfortable. Eventually you‚Äôll likely find yourself having to have conversations about how to adapt in more, shall I say, intimate ways too. Encourage him to read, but also to check in and ask how YOUR MS is affecting YOU. There is no one size fits all and he will need to understand as best he can how you feel, why you feel and what you need from him. Sometimes it will be support, other times space - but his biggest lesson will be to take his cues FROM you, not FOR you. \n\nWe dated for another five years after her diagnosis.\n\nAnd then we got married.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs been 7 more years since then.\n\nThe disease changes. It evolves. And so to will you, will he, will the both of you. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to establish open and honest lines of communication now. Never feel ashamed. Be honest. And make sure you both understand that what is true one day may be different the next and then even circle back the day after that.\n\nIn many ways I believe we are a stronger, more capable and more deeply in love couple than we may have otherwise been without being kind of forced to just grab each other by the hand and jump head first together. \n\nYou‚Äôll find your way.

i61zcgh,uaxcg7,"To be frank, its not necessarily the incompatibility of the activities you enjoy/can do. There are only so many music festivals a year, and I'm assuming there could be room to compromise in going to regular old shows (maybe just 1 or 2 bands at a time, but indoors, less walking, etc), or even it being something he goes to with friends instead of with you. \n\nThe issue I would have would be the giving up/throwing in the towel thing. The complete invalidation of my feelings (both physical and mental) and gaslighting isn't something I'm looking for in a long-term partner. \n\nWith there being no cure, none of us are getting ""better"" anytime soon, even if our disease progression is slowed considerably. Even with our meds, we're still getting worse (shitty to think about, but true), just slower than would naturally happen. I want a partner that respects that this disease is mine, but does everything they can to learn about what it is, and where it could go. I want to know 100% that if getting in the shower becomes an issue, they'll be open to remodeling so we can have a walk-in shower. If my walking becomes more of an issue, they're the first in line to help me find the most bad-ass cane imaginable. If stairs in the house become a struggle, they're on the phone with the realtor asking to start looking at single-story homes. \n\nThe man I was dating when I was diagnosed said he'd take me to my first MRI after I started my meds. I was scared to death they'd find something new and the Ocrevus wasn't working. He canceled 3 days before my MRI because he decided Dungeon Mastering his D&D game was more important (my MRI had been on his calendar for a month). That was after dating for 1.5 years. When we were in Peru, he gave the person walking us to our hotel HIS bag to carry up the insane hill with a 40-degree incline. I settled because I thought I was broken and no one would want me. We're now broken up, but at the time it seemed like an impossible decision. \n\nThe guy I'm dating now (and have been for maybe a month) picked up on how much pain I was in last night, noticed I was dropping things, and was having balance issues. He would grab the stuff I needed to carry, he made sure to stand by me and kept his hand on me to keep me steady, and when I was getting out of the booth at the restaurant he turned and helped me out instead of walking straight for the exit. \n\nI'm not saying your boyfriend is a bad guy, he could be great in 1,000 other ways, but I would encourage you to write out all the things you want for yourself in your future and with your future partner and see if that is something he can/will provide (realistically... because falling in love with potential is a pipe dream). I don't know you, but I do know how broken this disease can make us feel, and what it can do to our self-esteem.

He doesn‚Äôt understand why you wouldn‚Äôt just use a wheelchair or some other aide to help with the walking fatigue, mainly.

It‚Äôs hard to be out there as different and being in a wheelchair makes you feel different. It‚Äôs also tough that you can‚Äôt enjoy the venue in the same way everyone else is doing, with alcohol. He needs to understand that part. As he‚Äôs on the rise, enjoying the music, feeling the effects of alcohol and dancing, you‚Äôre on the downward slope of exhaustion.

In no way am I trying to be condescending)  \n\n\nI think for a lot of people, it's quite common to avoid Drs and difficult diagnosis. This can come either before seeking help or after a concerning revelation. Think about the classic 'heart attack' patient that most people think of. The guy in his mid-late forties, overweight and already starting to show signs. He goes to the Dr after his wife pushes and pushes him to and even though he's told he needs to change his habits, he refuses by going into denial. I liken what you've gone through to something similar. And, I can tell you I've seen it before, in many people - old and young.   \n\n\nMay I suggest that you think of your younger self as you were? Scared, possibly alone, the desire to want more from life but confused as to what that looked like generally but more specifically someone in your situation? Would you be angry at that young person for feeling that way? You might be frustrated with the way they responded but anger isn't going to help. You wouldn't be angry at a child for doing something a child would do, even if it's not in their best interest. And, although 19 isn't a child, being 19 is young to go through such upheaval.   \n\n\nYour disease may have progressed as it has despite intervention early on. Yes, that might be rare, but it is known to happen.   \n\n\nMay I also suggest that you take the time now to be with those you care about most, spend quality time with them and doing things you enjoy doing to the best of your ability. Stress, self-loathing can and will have a negative impact on your overall wellbeing. Consider your new results as though it was the first time you were diagnosed.

i5yy0d0,uajhv0,"It‚Äôs very random how flares affect us.  Someone can have 20 active lesions in a severe flare, but in areas of the brain that don‚Äôt produce clinical symptoms.  Other times, it just takes 1, in a critical place, to cause disability.  Unfortunately you fall into the latter.  \n\nI believe a spinal tap can be used in lieu of one of the qualifying criteria under the McDonald diagnostics.  Eg if your one lesion is considered typical of MS, a positive CSF finding is interesting, at least in confirming a diagnosis of CIS.  For true RRMS, you must have evidence of multiple lesions in multiple places.  That sucks for you- but a spinal tap showing bands in CSF, along with your lesion, might convince a neurologist to diagnose you as CIS and put you on a DMT to try to avoid/delay future lesions.  The DMTs are no joke- they carry risks to the extent even some fully confirmed patients won‚Äôt touch them.  You don‚Äôt want to take that by accident.  In your case, if a neurologist can be sure you are CIS, they can intervene to help you.  I‚Äôd do the spinal tap if I were you.\n\nThis video from the awesome Dr Beaber explains all that a lot better than I can üôÇ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixns85V95-Y",1650780287,t3_uajhv0,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uajhv0/do_ms_flare_ups_vary_in_strength_and_are_they/i5yy0d0/

i5yh9vh,uag1pi,"I think the key thing to note here is ""just got diagnosed."" I don't know about you, but when I was first diagnosed, I was a mess. I cried a lot and my life was over. I had a whole month of feeling like one of those overly dramatic people in old paintings (eyes to the sky, fainting into the arms of pitying cherubs). And then I moved on. Still had days like that but I had to learn to walk and feeling sorry for myself wasn't going to help me do that. \n\nGetting diagnosed is a grieving process. Denial hits hard, bargaining is always a good time, and anger and depression are a joy to go through. But after that, there's acceptance. I view my immune system as a functioning moron and my body as a failing meat suit that I'm along for the ride in. I was 27 when I was diagnosed. I'm 31 now and I actually feel like my life has finally started. \n\nWhen you see ""just diagnosed"" and ""my life is over"" in a post, ignore it. If you're not out the other side fo the process, it can bog you down. So until you are, just keep scrolling on by. Hell, go look at pictures of puppies or mountains you WILL climb when you want to.

It happens to all of us just cry as much as you want to, grieve the way you want and then get back on your feet. Everyone has his own struggles and fights and this is the card you were given. MS makes you see things differently, you start seeing the true value of all your blessings. Sure, it gets hard at times but it shall pass. When i was just diagnosed ,i was devastated and kept searching in groups people shared their experiences good and bad i kept a screenshot of all the good ones. MS treats everyone differently, make sure to make her treat you good. Being in a good mood  is a great remedy, and doing things you love. I also started going to gym regularly after my diagnosis (i used to go to gym before but allowed myself to be lazy most of the time) . I involved myself in many artistic activities (because when i was diagnosed i had a lot of free time and nothing to do besides thinking abt MS which was a total mood killer and life killer btw) \nThe neurologists said that it was ""better"" yo be diagnosed early to start medication and limit the effects on a long term. I love to believe that, since i started medication i didn't have any attack since 2020.\nI also had some sessions with a psychologist after the diagnosis that helped me a lot.\nSorry if i wrote a lot , seeing this made me remember my diagnosis seeing that i was younger than you ( why does it happen to me?

In present work we have characterized the nicotinic receptors expression in PBMC of RR-MS patients and healthy donors (HD) and their ability to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we report that the IL-1Œ≤ e IL-17 levels are significantly increased in serum of RR-MS patients in respect to HD and that the PBMC stimulation with PHA caused a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels both in RR-MS and HD subjects, with higher increase of protein release in RR-MS patients than in HD. The PBMC treatment with PHA plus nicotine produced a significant decrease of IL-1Œ≤ e IL-17 both as transcript and as protein, confirming that the PBMC of the patients respond to the cholinergic stimulation more than PBMC of HD. By real time PCR and western blot analysis we have also demonstrated that in particular Œ±7 receptor subtype appeared expressed at comparable levels both in RR-MS patients and HD. The PHA stimulation results to inhibit the Œ±7 subunit expression while the nicotine causes a significant increase in Œ±7 transcripts but only in MS patients. The data obtained highlight the role of Œ±7 receptor subtype in the modulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines also in MS. Moreover the ability of nicotine to up-regulate the expression of Œ±7 receptor subtype in RR-MS patients, indicates that nicotinic receptor stimulation may contribute to down-modulate the inflammation occurred in MS by a positive feedback control of its expression.\n\nNever smoke tobacco, but chew on gum or consume lozenges; there are more studies like this.",1650981248,t3_uadps7,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uadps7/does_anybody_use_nicotine_to_help_with_ms/i69l6s1/

A case was defined as a subject from the study base who had received a diagnosis of MS, and controls were randomly selected from the study base. The incidence of MS among smokers was compared with that of never-smokers. We also investigated whether the use of Swedish snuff had an impact on the risk of developing MS.\nResults: Smokers of both sexes had an increased risk of developing MS (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2‚Äì1.7 for women, and OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3‚Äì2.5 for men). The increased risk was apparent even among subjects who had previously smoked moderately (‚â§5 pack-years) prior to index, and the risk increased with increasing cumulative dose (p < 0.0001). The increased risk for MS associated with smoking remained up to 5 years after stopping smoking. In contrast, taking Swedish snuff for more than 15 years decreased the risk of developing MS (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1‚Äì0.8).\nConclusions: Smokers of both sexes run an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and the risk increases with cumulative dose of smoking. However, the use of Swedish snuff is not associated with elevated risk for MS, which may indicate that nicotine is not the substance responsible for the increased risk of developing MS among smokers.\n\n\n""....In contrast, taking Swedish snuff for more than 15 years decreased the risk of developing MS (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1‚Äì0.8)....""",1650981501,t3_uadps7,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uadps7/does_anybody_use_nicotine_to_help_with_ms/i69lsr9/
i6a1qry,uadps7,"Infiltration of CCR2+ Ly6Chigh proinflammatory monocytes and neutrophils into the central nervous system is modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a model of Multiple Sclerosis\n\nWei Jiang, St√©phanie St-Pierre, Patrick Roy, Barbara J Morley, Junwei Hao, Alain R Simard\n\nThe Journal of Immunology 196 (5), 2095-2108, 2016\n\nMyeloid cells, including proinflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, have important roles in the pathology of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These cells infiltrate the CNS in the early stages of disease development and contribute to the inflammatory response that is associated with symptom severity. It is thus crucial to identify and understand new mechanisms that can regulate the CNS infiltration of proinflammatory myeloid cells. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been increasingly studied for their immune-regulatory properties. In this study, we assessed the ability of nicotine, an nAChR ligand, to modulate proinflammatory myeloid cell numbers within the bone marrow, spleen, blood, and CNS of EAE mice. We found that nicotine significantly inhibits the infiltration of proinflammatory monocytes and neutrophils into the CNS at time points where these cells are known to play critical roles in disease pathology. In contrast, nicotine does not affect the expansion of other monocytes. We also show that nicotine exerts these effects by acting on Œ±7 and Œ±9 nAChR subtypes. Finally, mRNA transcript levels for CCL2 and CXCL2, chemokines involved in the chemotaxis of proinflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, respectively, are reduced in the brain of nicotine-treated EAE mice before the massive infiltration of these cells. Taken together, our data provide evidence that nAChRs can regulate proinflammatory cell infiltration into the CNS, which could be of significant value for the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760232/",1650987807,t3_uadps7,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uadps7/does_anybody_use_nicotine_to_help_with_ms/i6a1qry/
i6a26ek,uadps7,"The impact of coffee and caffeine on multiple sclerosis compared to other neurodegenerative diseases\n\nLena Herden, Robert Weissert\nFrontiers in nutrition 5, 133, 2018\n\nBackground:\nThe literature concerning the effect of coffee and caffeine on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with focus on fatigue is investigated in this review. Potentially clinically relevant effects were also assessed in studies concerning comparable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since the existing studies obtained very inconclusive results, we systematically reviewed these studies to summarize the evidence on the possible effects of coffee and caffeine on those disease entities. Previous studies suggested that coffee and caffeine intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing MS and other neurological diseases.\nMethods:\nThe PubMed database was searched using the keywords ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù OR ‚Äúcaffeine‚Äù in combination with keywords for each of the different diseases. Besides the keyword search, we included studies by reference list search. Studies on the effects of coffee and caffeine on the single neurological diseases were included for this review. A total of 51 articles met our inclusion criteria. The reviewed articles assessed the impact of coffee on the susceptibility for neurological diseases, as well as the effect of coffee on disease progression and possible symptomatic effects like on performance enhancement.\nResults:\nHigher intake of coffee and caffeine was associated with a lower risk of developing PD. In some of the MS studies there is evidence for a similar effect and experimental studies confirmed the positive impact. Interestingly in MS coffee and caffeine may have a stronger impact on disease course compared to effects on disease susceptibility. In ALS no such beneficial effect could be observed in the clinical and experimental studies.\nConclusion:\nThis literature assessment revealed that coffee and especially caffeine could have a preventative role in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, if provided in comparatively high doses. The systematic assessment indicates that coffee and caffeine intake must not be considered as a health risk. Additional clinical studies are needed to fully understand in how far coffee and caffeine intake should be considered as a potential therapeutic approach for certain disease entities and conditions.\n\nEasy and available add-on DMT",1650987973,t3_uadps7,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uadps7/does_anybody_use_nicotine_to_help_with_ms/i6a26ek/

Because I knew I had to continue to be there for my girls. Nothing else mattered.\n\nWelcome to 2022. The landscape on MS is so much better, but it will never be perfect. If you do end up being diagnosed with this bitch disease, know that there is no cure. Once the lesions show on your brain and/or spine, that is the sign that your nerves are damaged. They can never be repaired. But the treatments and programs available today, allow you to live such a full and complete life, you'll go days forgetting you have it.\n\nDoctors will treat your symptoms. The numbness will hopefully go away. Targeted exercises and diet help more than you realize. And there are a plethora of drugs today. Injectibles, pills, infusion. It's like a menu of choices. Make sure you look at any meds your neuro is recommending. Sometimes the side effects can be more harmful than the treatment itself.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to set your quality of life. Whatever plans you had for the future, can still happen as long as you temper your expectations. Vacations to tropical beaches are still good, but know that the heat will work against you. Walking is still possible, but understand that balance issues may force you to use a walking assist sooner than you thought. Don't try to be superman, the disappointment will hurt worse than the failure. But you control your life from here on out.\n\nFinal thoughts. Honesty. Don't try to hide this new life of yours from friends or family. Be open with the facts and your fears. You'll find support from all corners. And especially don't hide it from your kids. Let them be part of your journey. That way they will feel as if they are involved in what is now your new normal. And that will draw them closer to you than you realize. You may not be able to play catch, but all kids really want is a parent who does not put a wall between them.\n\nAnd last thought about the kids. Encourage them getting their drivers license at 16.

The younger the brain damage accumulates, the more drastically it will effect you as you age, and the more profoundly it will effect your quality of life. \n\nTreatment philosophies have started shifting over the last several years, particularly as more and more evidence clearly shows a drastic reduction in disability when you hit MS hard early on.

i5tjcj6,u9qovl,"MS is not just a physical or mental condition. I see it as more of a spiritual affliction. It can be hard to manage the obstacles MS throws at you. Especially when it keeps knocking you down and taking away what you love the most. But your body, mind, and spirit are incredible and can overcome this disease.\n\nAs you are familiar with, when the muscles in your body are put under stress, they break down and grow back stronger. Your mind is a lot like this as well. When your worldview and knowledge are challenged or shattered, you create new perspectives that are more enlightened and makes you wiser. However, your spirit is much more complex. It doesn‚Äôt so easily recover after being broken down. Fortunately though, if you can find the willpower to keep going and pursing your passions despite your challenges, your spirit has the potential to come back much stronger and better than your body or mind ever could.\n\nA great body and mind can inspire many, but those with a great spirit permeate  cultures and history and move people to be better versions of themselves. When I read your story, I am inspired by everything that have already done. This is without even factoring in your disability. Knowing that you have accomplished so much and stayed true to yourself and passions is incredible. You are a great person. Many great people have a hard life, and the greatest people continually struggle and overcome their adversities.\n\nWhen great people are faced with defeat and want to give up, they find the will to pick themselves up and form a new path with new goals and desires. I believe that you can do this. Your life seems well lived so far, but you still have so much potential for the future. I hope you are able to recover from this stage of your life and continue on doing what you love. But if not, you have potential for so much more. It is not a silver tongue or incredible strength that makes a great person. It may have been what you liked but the fortitude of your spirit is most important. If what you are experiencing now is the end of this chapter of your life, it is the beginning of a new one. Now, you have the opportunity to form new goals and ambitions. You also have the ability to assemble your story and use it to inspire others. No matter how it is delivered or what condition your body is in, you can use your willpower and empowered spirit to be a light in a dark place for many. If that is not what you wish to pursue, you can use your spirit to motivate yourself to make it through the day and accomplish smaller but still impressive self set goals. After all, look at how much you have overcame already\n\nI believe everything happens for a reason and can be used to better ourselves. You already have such and impressive life and are still young. You have so many possibilities going forward. You just have to keep you head held high and overcome your obstacles one day at a time. No matter what your physical condition is or how your words come out, you have infinitesimal value. While this is a trying period of your life, know that you will be able to reforge yourself so much stronger, and that the strength of your spirit will more than compensate for damage dealt to you body and mind. Your adversities are the temper you will use to sculpt your future and form your legacy.

Your determination in tackling the obstacles, (climbing, gym) your compassion in taking time out of your day to talk with others and help them (being the cool girl at the gym others look up to) your perseverance (continuing on when life gets tough).\nThese traits are what make you who you are.

i5qku0a,u9b9jg,"Hey friend! 23F here, I do agree that you should look into therapy. Realize that being diagnosed is a HUGE life change. It's not easy at all. Maybe you don't ""feel"" like you'd need therapy, but I think a lot of people would benefit from it, especially someone going through a huge life adjustment. I was diagnosed last year while I was in a PhD program. Now, I'm not in that program anymore and I'm still accepting, everyday, that I have MS. Even if it has been a year. This is hard, even WITH my (small) circle by my side. I also go through the whole wondering if I'm lazy, but I remind myself that I have a disease. Don't hold yourself to the standards of your pre-MS life. It's unrealistic and extremely hard on yourself. I'm looking into therapy once my brother goes back to work and I have the house empty and to myself, so I can (probably) look into telehealth and pour my guts out to a therapist. I've tried it before and it honestly felt like a weight off my shoulders, to pour my guts out to someone who will know what to do with all of these feelings I have. It's worth a shot.

i5ojtjk,u8z4gs,My bowel and bladder function were so bad I thought I was in diapers for life.  My bladder retention was worsening and leaking was worsening too so I was calling my doctor to \nsee if I need to begin catheterizing.  My doctor suggested Axonic sacral nerve stimulator implant for problems.   I have that device and I feel like I have my life back.   I can wear underwear again.  I can hold my bowels.  I can go out to eat and enjoy myself a bit.  I recommend if it gets.

i5plmal,u8z4gs,"I had a relapse, many years ago, where I would suddenly need to go #2 and I had basically 5 minutes to get to the toilet or else I would soil myself. That was rough, but it went away on it's own (PPMS and young, so it only lasted a few weeks).\n\nI actually have the opposite problem, now, where I am unable to use the toilet (#1 or #2). For a long time, I believed I was ""pee shy"", but it would happen at home, with no one else around.\n\nI have discovered ways to deal with it, over the years, and it really helps. If I close my eyes (or at least one eye), so that I can not see anyone else, I am able to focus on what I'm doing and can actually go #1. I am even able to use urinals again, doing this.\n\nIf going #2 is a problem, I often need to plug my ears. Not being able to hear anything but my breathing helps me to focus and allows me to go. Often, it's like I tell my body to push and it does the opposite, so I have to focus.\n\nOther tricks I have come up with are counting things in the room. If I can count quickly, I am usually focused on that and able to urinate after awhile.\n\nMS can be difficult, but these tricks have helped me greatly. I'm sorry you are having to deal with incontinence, but I hope it will improve soon! We each have our own trials and tribulations; just try to do your best to live your life regardless.

In the last three years I have been cathed 6 times.  4 of those times I was conscious and it hurt so bad they heard me screaming in pain out in the reception area.  I have also had 2 scopes and 2 dilation surgeries under GA with one week of shear hell with a foley in place.  My daughter said she heard me outside the hospital (small rural hospital) that first time.  My second time 6 months later they had to hold me down and injected lidocaine before a 12 fr was inserted. That still hurt like hell even after the lidocaine was in. I ended up scaring a few patients in the acute and long term wards with my screams that night (again a small rural hospital).  I felt bad they had to hear me, I did not want to scare anyone. \nIn October of last year my MS Uro tried to do a urodynamic study but they could not even insert the sensor (7 Fr) in due to urethral stenosis. It feels like I am being cut open with sandpaper from the inside out. A truly horrendous experience for me. My MS Uro was kinda shocked and did a quick external visual and said my urethral opening was very tight so the procedure was abandoned.  The prospect of having a catheter inserted so so frightening to me that I end up in a full blown panic attack. I'm shaking even now just thinking about it. \n\nI have no doubt that for the majority of people this is a mostly benign procedure. So many people self cath every day without incidents like this and I wonder what the hell is so wrong with me that it is so painful. My PT doctor thinks it is related to MS tone or spasticity that I have. \n\nHonestly, I would like to be able to do this. It would solve so many problems. But there are other reasons why I do not want to self-cath, but I do not want to go too far into those reasons. TMI, and I come out sounding like the biggest jerk in the world, in my opinion. \n\nSo, what are some options to decrease the pain of cathing until I am able to do it without being in so much pain?  I tried the breathing, the wiggling of my toes, and everything else that has been suggested by my Uro specialists. Nothing worked for me. And this not something I can just grin and bear it.

i5rxfk0,u8z4gs,I‚Äôve never had a catheter in the hospital that wasn‚Äôt a huge Foley.

The scope and sounds I was under GA. \n\nI do not think you were discounting my concerns.  I do appreciate an honest conversation about it.  You have been doing this for much longer than I've had MS and I would consider you to be the expert. This is something that has paralyzed me with fear since that first one in the ER almost 3 years ago. And they have all been brutal since. l totally accept that this is not the norm. I can also accept that there is a difference between the foleys at the hospital/clinics and the ones you get for at home. I have read a lot of testimonials about this taking a while to get used to, and that this is not really painful, for most. I have not heard about anyone having to self-cath and then down the road they are still in any serious pain from it. Most are like you and the others that have posted here...it was difficult or uncomfortable (not painful) for a while but eventually they got used to it. And I can accept that. \n\nI have thought about getting those free samples that are offered at companies that sell catheters. I know this is probably not the best idea.  I have observed the procedure I don't know how many times in a hospital setting (I used to work in the ER some 20 years ago), I've read the instructions over and over, and watched several instructional videos and I am confident that I could teach myself to do this.  It does not seem that difficult at all. I just do not know how to deal with that kind of pain. And, I know the sensation is not that big of a deal after you get used to it.\n\nAre my experiences creating a mental block? Very likely. Am I just letting myself get worked up about it? Again, very likely. Pain is a huge motivation for self preservation and I just cannot seem to get around that.  Even when my bladder has not been able to empty after 15 hours of trying was not anywhere near as painful as what my experiences of being catheterized has been.

Furthermore, it was based on Rituximab which has been in use (and used off-label for MS) for many decades.  Ocrevus is a more humanized version of Rituximab. \n\nYour concern around being among students and being immune suppressed is absolutely valid.  Although, you would retain your memory B cells (which store your long term immunization memory).

i5k5lh3,u88ldb,Ocrevus is relatively new but it and Kesimpta are very similar to rituximab. I'm on Kesimpta and personally I'm reassured by the decades of safety data behind rituximab that there isn't likely to be some big surprise pop up at this point.\n\nGilenya's black box warning scared me off a bit and my neurologist agreed - there's a small risk of severe progression if you ever stop Gilenya. I might have been willing to accept that risk if it were the most effective treatment but it isn't and I'm more comfortable accepting a very small risk of infection over severe disability.,1650503825,t1_i5js4s9,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u88ldb/tecfidera_vs_gilenya/i5k5lh3/

i5kdm0w,u88f2d,I got SSDI on first time through.\n\nMy advice is get a lawyer.  Make sure your neurologist is behind you applying.  Once you confirm the neurologist is supportive ask his office staff who they like working with for a good reference.  Here is a link to the SSDI  bluebook its the requirements for getting approved. https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm\n\nIt boils down to three categories.\n1 two nonfunctional limbs \n2 legally blind \n3 impairment to the point your unable to hold any job. (Hardest to prove)\n\nYou want the neurologist statements to include all your symptoms that impact in those areas.\n\nThis will take awhile 6 months from your last day working before you can apply.  Then the process takes minimally three to five months.\n\nMine was fast got through first time with the covid backlog it was 11 months include the six month waiting period before you can apply.,1650507318,t3_u88f2d,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u88f2d/disability_benefits_usa/i5kdm0w/
i5onno2,u88f2d,"Qualifications: I was approved for SSDI on my first application when I was 30, three years ago, right when my wife finished law school (so I had informal legal advice). Applied in early July, was approved and got my first payment in November or December. \n\nMy advice:\n\n- when filling out paperwork about ADLs, answer questions starting with ‚Äúon my worst days I can _____‚Äù and then go on to ‚Äúon my better days I can _____‚Äù to show the range of your symptoms and their impact. (For example, I said that on my worst days I couldn‚Äôt do the laundry at all and had to ask my wife to carry the clothes up and down the stairs, but on my better days I could scoot down the stairs with clothes in my lap and drag a laundry bag up the stairs behind me.)\n\n- get documentation for everything. I saw a neuropsychologist for four hours of cognitive testing to document memory impairment and slowed processing speed, an ophthalmologist to document lingering vision loss from ON, and I went to my physical therapist before and during my application period so that she could document my degree of spasticity, walking speed, and other motor symptoms. I even got a letter from my therapist saying she was pleased that I was applying for benefits because she‚Äôd been encouraging me to stop working for over a year. \n\n- send in all the paperwork you have. Don‚Äôt skimp. More is more in this case. \n\n- if your husband, like my wife, is given forms to fill out about how MS impacts you on a daily basis, ask him to be unflinchingly honest. This was hard for my wife because she generally tries to focus on my better days than my worse, but being gentle wasn‚Äôt going to do me any favors! \n\nYour work history and education level impact your approval. I was a nanny for ten years and didn‚Äôt finish college - things that made me more likely to be approved than somebody with an advanced degree and a history of office work. \n\nApplying was emotionally grueling. Detailing all of the things I can‚Äôt do anymore was really hard on me. Going to more appointments than usual was hard on me. I was exhausted. Take care of yourself during this process, and good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1650585302,t3_u88f2d,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u88f2d/disability_benefits_usa/i5onno2/

I went on modified duty at work and began working significantly less hours, otherwise if I didn't go back I would lose my insurance benefits, SSDI just helped supplement my hours lost. SSDI is temporary, I believe its up to a year, whereas SSI is long-term. From what I can tell SSI is if you've lost all ability to do any work and your physicians have signed off on that.

i5ivlur,u7zi8y,"Hey, Hi! I'm a hobby pilot and I've spent a lot of time talking with AOPA.\n\nYou can keep at least a 3rd class medical, but there are extra steps. Firstly, you will need a special issuance from the FAA. It's detailed in the AME guide [here](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item46/amd/dd/). AOPA told me the FAA would likely require a blood test and neurological report every year as part of the SI.\n\nDMT's are not disqualifying. Ocrevus has specifically been [approved](https://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/designees_delegations/designee_types/ame/fasmb/media/2021_Volume%2056-1.pdf). Kesimpta, though, is too new. AOPA told me that a drug must be on the market for 2 years before the FAA even looks at it and Kesimpta was only approved in August of 2020.\n\nAfter talking to AOPA, and to an AME, I decided to go the BasicMed route. If you qualify for it, I would highly recommend it. It's done through your primary care physician.

In addition to talking to your doctor, you can also do your own research to get a better understanding of MS, how it will probably affect your life as well as what you can do about it. About 98% of those who are diagnosed before they turn 20 years old have RRMS (relapsing-remitting MS) where symptoms come and go. Btw, even if your symptoms are gone, the disease is still able to progress. It can take about 15 to 20 years for your RRMS to develop into SPMS (secondary progressive MS) which happens to the majority of MS patients but not all. Currently, it is not possible to predict who will eventually develop SPMS but there is a new diagnostic approach that is being tested. Researchers have found biomarkers that will lead to earlier diagnoses of SPMS as well as studies of the efficacy of new medications to treat the condition. You can [check out this link](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/trevis-gleason-life-with-multiple-sclerosis/study-identifies-potential-biomarker-for-spms/) for more info on this SPMS diagnostic method. \n\nMultiple sclerosis treatment has three main goals which is to treat attacks, to relieve symptoms, and to prevent future attacks. There are several MS drug treatments already in the clinical trial stages and some that have already been approved. As some people have commented, it is possible that in a couple of decades, there will be a cure for MS or at least medications that slow down the progression by 95%. Researchers have also found that diet, physical activity levels and lifestyle also play a role in MS pathogenesis and management ‚Äì you can [check out this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620342/) for more info. There is no special diet for MS but the Mediterranean diet has shown a positive effect on MS course in animal models as well as humans. Conversely, the Western diet typically has highly saturated fats and carbohydrates and it is not recommended because it can lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory immune pathways. Add probiotic foods to your daily diet since they affect your gut microbiome which in turn has a positive impact on immune system function. With regard to alcohol, most doctors recommend nothing more than the occasional glass of wine or beer as even moderate drinking could worsen neurological damage. Exercise on a daily basis and don‚Äôt stick with just one type of exercise but go with combined exercise training instead. Hope this helps.",1650949579,t3_u7ybz1,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u7ybz1/19_m_just_got_diagnosed_with_multiple_sclerosis/i68a9dz/

Do yourself a favor and get a Lyme test. The test itself can be unreliable but it‚Äôs worth a shot. The best test is from igenex. If you‚Äôre interested watch the documentary under our skin on Amazon prime.\nAlso exercise and diet, yes anecdotal for Ms right now but more research is coming out.

I have heard people have had hair loss, but in my own experience, I have a full head of hair still. Sometimes, I look up Ocrevus' side effects to see if any of it matches up. Fatigue is the only one I've noticed, but if it gets bad, I take modafinil. My immune system is compromised, yes, but I take precautions that anyone else is taking: mask, I carry clorox wipes, and hand sanitizer. I got COVID in January after two years of complete precautions, but the vaccines helped a lot. I recovered just as any person would, thankfully. Also, no allergic reactions, just the usual little side effects to the steriods and benadryl that anyone else could have during the infusion. Itchy throat, hot flash, but it passes. I was also hesitant for Ocrevus and, by all means, if you don't think it's a right fit, then I totally respect that, just sharing my opinion.

Since the 5th grade, I've had a fear of vomiting but, with my MS diagnosis last year, I accepted that vomiting is a fact of life sometimes and it's gross. However, it is not the end of the world and it will come and go. After I threw up, I felt better and I realized that throwing up was not the end of the world. It would actually make me feel a bit better. As I said, I threw up due to heat, not due to any treatment. That's just how my body reacted, I'm not saying it'll happen to you.

And unfortunately not a lot of high quality data exists for the minor cannabinoids and their specific effects. However, from the resources I've reviewed it seems CBD and CBN are best for helping with nerve-related pain. CBD is specifically good for treating pain related to inflammation. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system to effect the way the body perceives pain at pain receptors. CBN has shown to be helpful specifically for spasticity. Both CBD and CBN have some evidence to support possible neuroprotection. And of course, THC is going to probably be the ""heaviest  hitter"" on pain control. THC works mostly centrally, so it effects the way your body perceives pain and responds to pain. So if your looking for immediate relief THC will get you there first (along with the possibly unwanted psychoactive effects as well). CBD and CBN may be better at reducing and preventing that pain. Using cannabinoids in combination will yield best results. \n\nIf you're interested in terpenes to aid in effects: products or strains high in caryophyllene, humulene, and myrcene content are the ones I would look for.

Anyway, I have to insist, GH administration does not avoid the MS but myelinates lesions, as we saw with Schwann cells in rats with the sciatic nerve sectioned, treated with GH, they recovered fully limb function while saline-treated rats got paralytics: \nGrowth hormone treatment enhances the functional recovery of sciatic nerves after transection and repair.\nDevesa P, Gelabert M, Gon≈∫lez-Mosquera T, Gallego R, Relova JL, Devesa J, Arce VM.",1650460799,t1_i5h6wow,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u7j6dj/best_cannabinoids_for_myelin_sheath_repair/i5h7him/

i5dxauw,u74c2t,"Howdy.  I'm 48M, diagnosed at the beginning of the pandemic when I was 47.  I actually had my first symptoms when I was 45 but got mis-diagnosed with Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome--numbness in my feet which spread up my legs to my fingers.  I was left with permanent numbness in my fingers, probably because I also had pretty significant carpal tunnel in both wrists.  In late June 2020, I lost the eyesight in my right eye over two days.  After a few days in the ER, I got my initial diagnosis of MS, confirmed by my new neuro a couple of months later.  Thankfully, my eye site responded to some strong steriods, and it returned as quickly as it went away.\n\nI was put on a DMT pretty quickly, Kesimpta--which is VERY similar to Ocrevus.  I have had a few MRIs since then, which have shown zero progression.  I still deal with some symptoms--particularly heat induced, but they're manageable.\n\nHaving been diagnosed later in life is somewhat rare, and I think, a pretty positive thing.  We've not been dealing with debilitating symptoms for decades already, and are already on a highly effective DMT.  And more importantly, the breakthroughs in research are coming fast and furious--it's an incredible time to be diagnosed, even compared to ten years ago.  They're talking about treatments that prevent relapses--not just delay them.  And now they're talking about being able to reverse the damage!  Holy cow!\n\nYou're not an asshole--this disease is.  That said, hey...it wasn't a stroke, heart attack or cancer!  You're not alone.  You've found an incredible support group here.",1650397950,t3_u74c2t,/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u74c2t/my_life_feels_like_it_is_over/i5dxauw/

I can tell you, of course it's scary, but don't lose hoop! Symptoms can come, but they can also go again for a certain level. Yes, there's not a ""final cure"" for now, but the meds have become pretty good and I guess that they'll only improve in the future. One last advice: if your body is overheating or tells you in other ways ""I have enough for now"", just take a break and don't stress yourself too much.

Make sure your vitamin D levels are good, it is shocking what a difference it makes. When I did a keto/ low carb diet, I felt amazing. Normal even.

i5ivmdd,u6ycwl,"Hey, I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. MS is no fun. Fortunately, it gets better with time! Vitamin D will be very important going forward as well as minimizing your chances of developing other health conditions. A healthy diet with exercise will be crucial for your long term health, despite how difficult it will be initially. Since you are young, the best thing will be to find a strong DMT medication. I would recommend Ocrevus since it is conventiant and has worked great for me. But everyone is different so yeah. Some things to avoid would be smoking and alcohol. A little won‚Äôt hurt you but if you get into the habit of either it can make your condition way worse. Coping with symptoms will depend on your symptoms. For me, I bought socks with ice pads in them, cooling rags for when I exercise, and have tried various gels/creams for nerve pain. I also did droppers and edibles with CBD/THC in them, though they don‚Äôt help with memory. I have also taken adderall to help with focus and retention in school. There are many side effects to adderall but I found it was worth it since it is hard to pay attention when you feel like crap. It also gives immense energy. \n\nJust stay positive and do what feels best for you! Remember, how you feel now is not how you will feel forever! Once you get going on treatment, you will see results, though it‚Äôll be slow. I‚Äôve almost had MS for 4.5 years now and I feel almost completely normal.

MRI showed 4 lesions, two of which went unnoticed on a previous MRI and two new ones- my neuro said it‚Äôs from my migraines.

I spent ages trying to find a neuro who would listen to me because all my notes say ‚Äúmigraines‚Äù. I begged my neuro to send me to an MS specialist and she was extremely rude but in the end did refer me. \n\nThe MS specialist apologized for the last neuro and told me that just based off my lesions and symptoms she would support me if I‚Äôd like to start treatment. She explained what I‚Äôd be prescribed as well as how to administer it (copaxone) she then scheduled a thoracic MRI but said if I would start meds even if thoracic came back clear.

Last week I was traveling and found myself back to my same issues, although not as bad as before starting the steroids.\n\nLate last week, I also started experiencing double vision. This one they are more sure is a relapse, so we decided to do 3 days of steroid I fusions again.

Haha\n\nI have a feeling I'm going to make it to some kind of older age though... Ever since that one collision I've been making it a point to just do what I want to in life....\n\nI just got done eating my strawberry shortcake...
