These braces help me so much! \nThe only downside is they're a bit bulky! I have very wide feet, and then adding the bulk of the braces makes it very hard for me to find high top shoes/boots to fit them in. But it's worth it to be able to walk! I hope this helps! Oh also, they last about 6-8 months wearing them daily. The Velcro stats to degrade and doesn't hold as well, and the plastic starts to break. You know when it's time to replace them!

I've been on various types of opioid in the past and it does help more than the above, they avoid putting me on it these days due to the opioid scare... if the pain gets more than the Meloxicam can handle I usually move onto Delta 9 (MMJ isn't legal here) or Advil (all the doctors say I shouldn't but have no other options so it is what it is). I also have Lidocaine patches which offer limited help if you are having pain in a specific location, but I don't usually bother too much... but it does help some. I haven't taken Tylonel in years, stuff is worthless for me now, but if it helps for you it helps for you that's what matters.\n\nYour best option is to profy if you can... I got factor a few times a month when I was a kid but it wasn't profy, profy didn't really come into my sphere until the mid-90s and it has been difficult to get a pattern going though I've gotten better.

Part of the trouble is the price (because certain strains are OBNOXIOUSLY expensive depending on the grower, I'm in PA where it's like $375 an ounce) and the other part is its just not strong enough.

i58x78q,u6avz2,"Severe hemophilia A here. You absolutely need to be on prophylactic factor 8 infusions starting now. It is covered by insurance under major medical, unlike Hemlibra which is covered under your prescription plan. You are experiencing pain because you are bleeding. Not much will stop that but factor. I‚Äôm not sure that Hemlibra is even available for people with mild hemophilia. Do whatever you can to get factor. Start now, don‚Äôt delay. The damage is being done. All you can do in the meantime is rest and ice your sore spots. 15 mins at a time, no longer. As often as every hour. Speak to a hemophilia treatment  center. Hematologists don‚Äôt always know very much about hemophilia, sometimes very little. There‚Äôs a lot to know. Call a HTC right away and get in to see an expert. This could be very much better in a few months if you follow this advise. This is standard advise, standard protocol. You‚Äôll need to be on every other day infusions that raise your factor level to 100% or greater until you have no pain and as much mobility back as you did before these problems started. I‚Äôm 47, severe A (less than 1%) and have zero joint pain or any pain, I swim and trail ride a motor-cross bike, cross country ski, work full time, no problems, because I treat my hemophilia properly. I‚Äôm very careful and have had a lot of injuries over the years, and I‚Äôve spent plenty of down time recovering from joint and muscle bleeds. For a severe hemophilia this is standard. I‚Äôve remained very active and am well educated and have a great support system of drs so I have avoided a lot of the the problems most guys my age have. Moderate hemophilia is another story tho. You didn‚Äôt even know you had it until now. You have the very real possibility of gaining back 100% of your health and never having pain again if you understand this: what you are lacking is factor 8. Nothing else is going to help in any real meaningful way. You need to get proper treatment. Asap. It‚Äôs the only thing that will help and it will help tremendously. Within a few months of rest and prophylactic infusions you will most likely be feeling much better. Depending on how bad these bleeds have been let go, and how much joint damage has been done, it might take a year or so of gradually getting more active ,  physical therapy (with a hemophilia trained PT) would be helpful. But there is no reason that you won‚Äôt be back to 100%, possibly even feeling better than you‚Äôve ever felt, because you may have needed factor this whole time. I know it might be hard to fathom. I know when my body is hurting it‚Äôs hard to imagine that I could get better. But with rest and proper treatment you will get better. But the only thing that‚Äôs going to help you will be getting your factor 8 level high enough for long enough in order to heal. As well as common sense and taking care of your body. After you‚Äôre feeling better you may only need to infuse every so often when you feel the need. I work in Hemophilia, this is what I have done for a living for the past 20 years. I work with doctors and nurses and the treatment center in my area. If there‚Äôs anything I can do to help please message me. I might be able to point you in the right direction.

Both my sons (I had another hemophiliac because I am an overachiever, apparently) are on Hemlibra and barely ever have bleeds. I would not be afraid to have a third hemophiliac. It barely affects them anymore. Five years ago it ruled our lives and I lived in terror, plus the daily infusions via port and all that entails. \n\nYou have a 50% chance of any boy you have being hemophiliac.

But, it's very manageable and though it does require some planning and extra care and doctors here and there, any kids you have will be able to lead fairly normal lives. My dad for instance had moderate hemophilia and was a mechanic his whole life. If you're picturing bubble boy, throw that thought away. Treatments have come a long way.\n\n(2) you may want to also think back on your own health history and have your own Factor 8 levels checked. Think about period flow, gums bleeding, etc. Though it is definitely not always the case, some carriers have impacted factor 8 levels and may too have hemophilia. I did not know this information until recently, and have found out my % is around 14-25% meaning I have mild hemophilia. So just wanted to share as it's something to consider and get checked. \n\n(3) If you should get pregnant, you can pass it on to your children but its not a guarantee (my sister has 1 hemo boy and 1 boy without hemophilia). While males are certainly more likely to inherit hemophilia than females, just because you have a girl does not mean they are in the clear. Males they typically test at birth knowing you are a carrier, and I would definitely request that if you know you are having a boy. My sister's baby bled profusely from the heel prick at birth, so that was a pretty good indicator before they actually tested his levels.

If you want to bare children one day, you will want to be knowledgeable about what to expect, treatment, etc ahead of time. It‚Äôs just going to be a huge advantage.\n\nThe other thing is - don‚Äôt freak out. If I were in your shoes I‚Äôd probably be worried about my dads health and the health of my kids if I had any, or wanted to have any. Hemophilia can be tricky to handle, but the treatments available today are really amazing and life changing for someone like me whose had it since 1985.

Depending on your emotional habits, you might take these news pretty badly. For example, if you take this to mean that something is wrong with you and have a hard time accepting it. My advice would be not to hide from your feelings. Giving birth is hard enough. If you can avoid feelings of guilt due to your being a carrier, I would suggest you start working on that now. Therapy could be good.\n\nSecond, ask your doctor about it. Think both fertility options (if you care about that), and of course treatment options in case of a hemophiliac boy. Depending on your country and personal circumstances, they will help you understand the implications. Go from there.

What it means in brief is that you may have some symptoms (heavy periods etc) but generally will have a normal day to day life. When you or if you want to have kids with someone that does not have haemophilia  it means that any girls you have will have a 50% chance of being a carrier and any boys you have will have a 50% chance of having haemophilia. \n\n\nSo for me, as my other half has haemophilia and I am assumed I‚Äôm normal, all our girls will be carriers and all our boys will be normal.

I once missed a shipment because the shipper messed up, and after 3 days in a warehouse, it was no good. I only found out because I started getting bleeds. Because of this, I now try to schedule my deliveries for wednesdays or thursdays so if I have to go to a facility, I have a day to do it before the weekend when they‚Äôre closed.\n\n- 90% of the time it‚Äôs painless.

Maybe there‚Äôs a problem in my technique, I‚Äôm not sure.\n\n- it may take some time to find the balance of trusting the hemlibra versus doing an IV. For me at least, it took a few months before I realized some of my ‚Äúarthritis pain‚Äù was actually daily ankle bleeds. He may still need to do an IV every now and then.

hy6r7op,szz0up,"Bleeds can take 6 to 8 weeks or more to resolve. And that‚Äôs if the bleeding was stopped and you haven‚Äôt re injured it. Which is really hard with any bleed, especially elbows. You need to immobilize it as much as you can. Keep it elevated above your heart untill the bleed stops. A sling or a brace or an ace bandage will help. Don‚Äôt wrap it too tight, just enough so you keep it immobile. You need to keep it absolutely still until it is healed. Don‚Äôt try to bend it or even move your shoulder or wrist too much. Stay still. Infuse as much as you‚Äôre able to. For a bad bleed I would infuse my prescribed amount every 8 hours the first day, then every 12 hours for the next few days , and every day for a week or two  after that. Then every other day until it is fully healed. And if I bump it or re-injure it at all, I infuse again right away and if the re-injury is bad enough I start the process over, infusing every 12 hours, etc. Once you are getting better enough to take the bandage or cast off, ice it for 15 mins every hour as often as you‚Äôre able to help it heal faster. It‚Äôs a serious injury so treat it as such. Call your dr and be seen by a HTC if you‚Äôre able to. But even if they say you‚Äôre able to start using your arm again, still take it easy. Most drs don‚Äôt know how much it takes baby-ing a bleed to really get it to heal. The more patient you can be the better off you‚Äôll be.

If you can afford it, or if your clinic will give them to you, make sure you get one of those fancy tourniquets that have a button and they come undone. The tie-up tourniquets are an actual nightmare. \n\nThe second thing that works well is to drink a bunch of water 20-30 minutes before injecting, that way your veins are bigger. \n\nThird, I found one of those stress balls, the squeezy ones, and I will hold that in my hand to steady it and it helps to push the veins up a little more and make the surface easier to inject into.\n\nFourth, a big one for me is the set and setting. This is purely anecdotal, but I found I have much better success when I do medication in a comfortable setting. I always do it at my computer desk, I have become accustomed to the height of the desk, my chair, etc. I try to remove as many of those variable type things that could affect me. \n\nHonestly, I switched over to Hemlibra two years ago.

hx94fks,sua5ke,"Thanks for the kind words <3\n\nI know there are other trans folk with hemophilia out there. I also know the information generally isn't available so it's easy for someone to think they're alone in this or that they can't transition because of hemophilia. Apart from a small segment in a trans media piece I've not come across anything helpful, so hopefully someone will find this post helpful. If nothing else it will show them that it is possible.\n\nAs for testosterone, estrogen, and blood clots. Your body needs hormones to be within certain ranges for it to function effectively. If you have low (or no) hormones stuff doesn't work.  As you said, testosterone promotes muscle growth and muscles provide stability and a bit of padding. So that might play a role in overall health.\n\n Generally speaking you can have low testosterone or low estrogen, but if you have both low you get into trouble. Estrogen itself increases your risk of blood clots, sometimes with serious effect. I'm a little fuzzy on the exact mechanism, but I know it's not F VIII related. My hematologist has me scheduled for another factor assay to see if any of my clotting responses have increased. Although any increase likely won't be enough to change my treatment plan and certainly won't affect the joint damage that already exists.",1645062129,t1_hx90yy8,/r/Hemophilia/comments/sua5ke/hemophilia_and_gender_transition/hx94fks/

hxauokn,sua5ke,"That's a frustratingly common misconception. So, people with hemophilia aren't going to 'bleed out' from minor injuries like needle injections, paper cuts, bumps, or small cuts. We wouldn't bleed to death any faster than you would bleed to death. It's just that my blood doesn't form blood clots as well as your blood does. I can get shots and blood draws just the same as anyone else. The severity of my hemophilia just means that after major injuries or before surgeries I need expensive medicine (clotting factor) to heal properly.  \nAs for injections, you are correct, I probably won't use them because due to the frequency and potential to hit a blood vessel. This wouldn't kill me but it would create a much larger bruise than in someone without hemophilia. My primary physician has recommended against them but I'm going to talk it over with my hematologist to get their input.  I tried patches, and really liked them but thanks to American Healthcare (tm) they were prohibitively expensive. \n\nSince I brought surgeries up.

Carriers with mild Hemophilia A. So I speak a bit from experience here. \n\n> What should I be prepared for?\n\nNot much. \n\nMild Hemophilia won't impact you day-to-day with the exception of: intense physical activities, surgeries, serious injuries/emergencies, breakout bleeds, and other extraordinary events. So you can expect to be prescribed prophylaxis medication to treat your Hemophilia for those extreme situations.  \n\nAlso be prepared to tell *all* of your doctors that you're a mild Hemophiliac. They need this information for even minor surgeries, prescribing you medication, and diagnosing health problems.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll also get a fun bracelet or necklace that'll tell any medics incase of an emergency that you're a Hemophiliac. \n\n> What questions should I ask?\n\nEvery question necessary for you to understand what Hemophilia is, what it does to your body, what your medicine does. Questions like: \n\nWhat causes Hemophilia? What's the difference between mild and severe Hemophilia? \n\nWhen do I need to take my prophylaxis treatment and what does it do?\n\nWhat constitutes a ""bleed"" and how do I treat it?\n\nWill I suffer from having a ""target joint"" and should I be concerned about ""micro bleeds""?\n\nWhat are the long term impacts of mild Hemophilia and what parts of my life does it effect?\n\nWho needs to know that I have Hemophilia? \n\nFinally and unrelated, but any time you undergo something as serious a C-section **DO NOT** neglect to tell your doctor that your father had Hemophilia or that you have mild Hemophilia. Hemophilia is very serious, and untreated bleeds can lead to deadly consequences. \n\nOtherwise welcome to the club! Once you speak with your hematologist you'll realize Hemophilia is not too scary!

I even had to ask him to draw blood to confirm my level because he wasn't even going to do that. I just feel so...dismissed?

I used to also get terrible nosebleeds during winter time (1 or 2 nose bleeds every other day).

Among four participants, there were seven nonsustained elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels that met protocol-specified toxicity criteria: six elevations were grade 1 (>2.5 to 2.9 times the upper limit of the normal range), and one elevation was grade 2 (Fig. S3). All these nonsustained elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels occurred in participants in two vector dose cohorts (1.5√ó1012 vg per kilogram and 2√ó1012 vg per kilogram), and these elevations occurred during a cellular immune response against SPK200 that resolved with the use of\nglucocorticoids.",1642628843,t1_htbp8mk,/r/Hemophilia/comments/s64qsm/it_gave_me_my_life_back_after_years_of_pain_from/htdi2zp/

i2l6zc5,s4nk3d,"You can also try applying pain relieving cream/lotion (beware of those containing salicylic acid - it is actually aspirin) at the lower back when the hip starts feeling strange (chances are hip is fine and it is the muscle acting up). When I started doing that, my psoas ""bleed"" episodes recovered much more quickly - think of it as a cramp. Cramps are really painful, but it isn't necessarily bleeding yet. So by relieving the cramp and allowing the muscle to get back into its original position, issue is resolved. Over time, my psoas episodes eventually vanished. I think the entire period I had psoas issues was around 17 years old and lasted for around 13 years with admission to hospital each time and even ending up on crutches. All those stopped after around 13 years and I am unsure if it was due to application of muscle relieving lotion (it's some strange brand - I don't even know if I can find it anymore and at that time I never looked at the ingredients, but it had a very strong smell) or if I just outgrew it. Perhaps other haemophiliacs who had suffered from psoas bleeds can share their experience so we know if it is an age thing that will pass. But also, if you look at the time it started, that is around the peak of male growth, so you might want to hold back on doing ""male things"" when your psoas is giving you trouble, because it is a muscle and doing ""male things"" stresses that muscle - from my experience, it can be recovering but each time I did a ""male thing"", the condition will worsen thereafter and it was back to the hospital for more Factor VIII the next day.

In my case I was cleared to have one but had to have a full dose of Humate first (which my doctor prescribed to me to have at home and bring with me to the hospital so there would be no delay or issue in filling the RX at the hospital).  When I got to the hospital I was already 7cm dilated and wanted the epidural right away but the anesthesiologist on call was a massive jerk and said he could not find instructions in my chart so he would not give it to me.  I begged him for four hours to please just call my hematologist (who btw is the head of the department at this particular hospital and told me he would be on call for me for the three days surrounding my due date which I went into labor on...).  FINALLY 4 hours later they called him because the nurse reamed the doctor for being such an ass and low and behold he confirmed the instructions I had already given them and allowed for the epidural (all this time I was not dilating more probably because I was so tense from the pain, they gave me the epidural and I almost immediately went to 10 and was pushing within 30 minutes).

hr9veug,rw6gdl,"Hi,  \nSo to kick it off, I also moved from Poland at the age of 13 (turned 30 4 weeks ago, also have Severe Hem. A), not to Ireland but to The Netherlands. Pretty funny.  \n\n\nAnyway, speaking from experience there are two major factors that play a role for poeple like us (growing up without prophylaxis).  \nA) How bad did it get when you were still living without factor XIII back in the days. For example, do you have any major injuries/any other problems that can not be cured. For examle, my angles are pretty damaged, so no matter what I do right now, it will probably never get much better.  \n\n\nB) How well you take care of yourself right now and in the future. Sounds cliche, but it really is the truth. I used to go to the gym, kept my weight at around 80kg, did a lot of cardio and ate well. Couple of years ago I turned into a retard, and since then I don't work out, gained like 20 kg's of fat. The change is drastic. From a fit guy that could do everything, nowadays it happens twice a month that I get a bleeding just because I went for a walk.   \nObviously the reason is I fucked up with my diet and workouts, but I never expected for the change to be so drastic. So just a tip, DON'T get lazy. You will regret it. I know I do. And it's hard to go back. Like my shape is so bad, everytime I try to get going, I get a bleeding.  \n\n\nAnyway, I know it's long, but wanted to add my 2 cents.  \nIf you ever wanna talk, my fellow age-origin-history-type guy, you can DM me!

I am pretty confident that as long as I keep exercising and eating well, and don‚Äôt make any big mistakes or have a major accident, my body will last as long as anyone else‚Äôs. Possibly longer, because I have noticed that the level of care I take of myself is more than the average guy my age, and because of that I‚Äôm in above average shape, as far as having tons of injuries or pain.

hr79t03,rvr3ic,Ankles are a tough one.  I've (severe A 45) have been holding out for something better than fusing but I think that's my only realistic option.  Going to see an orthopedic surgeon in a couple of weeks.  We have a member on here that had an allograft (cadaver) replacement a while back.  The recovery and physical therapy was a long and difficult process but major orthopaedic surgeries are hard work.  Hopefully they'll chime in on the process.  I'm not familiar with the requirements but I know it's not usually the first option offered.  You probably need to meet certain criteria to be considered.  I hope you find a good option for your ankle.  Sounds like you're in a difficult situation.,1641295972,t3_rvr3ic,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rvr3ic/ankle_replacement/hr79t03/
hr7lz32,rvr3ic,"Don't have much time at current to fully weigh in here but I'm currently looking into going through this myself. Currently the date for surgery is in May of this year. For what it's worth, all the talk of arthrodesis vs. arthroplasty... If you're young (I'm 35) they prefer to recommend fusion. The reason being that replacements wear out and will need revision. But that seems like buck passing to me as well because it just shifts the problems to other joints, causing radiographic damage to them eventually.  Better yet there aren't really any options for THOSE joints once they're damaged. This is why I'm opting for the replacement. The technology is newer and more refined than previous implants. My orthopedic surgeon (Dr. William C. McGarvey, Houston, TX) is actually a design  consultant for Wright, the company that makes the implant. If you are not incredibly active an implant isn't exactly contraindicated but the longer between you and the grave the more certain your need for revision. \n\nWhat I can tell you is this... 90% of the ankles installed make it 10 years. Of the ones that do not make it better than 85% fail in the first 3 years. Basically, if it's going to fail it typically does so pretty quickly. In this case ""failure"" is simply a word meaning: ""requires revision or surgical intervention"" meaning anything from an infection to a plastic pad replacement to granulation in the soft tissues of the ankle. So... Every problem from big to small. I have asked about literature regarding what KINDS of revisions are needed in those 3 years and the answer is consistently something to the tune of: ""there likely IS data but compiling and publishing it would do little good as every situation is case specific and there would likely be little to gain."" \n\nHaving said that, you might also ask about arthrodesis as a preparatory to arthroplasty. I have read that for patients  that are younger or more active they can fuse your ankle in such a way that later, when other joints show excess wear, they can cut it apart and then replace the joint with an implant. This protects you from implant failure while young but also relives those other joints from wear later on.",1641303293,t3_rvr3ic,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rvr3ic/ankle_replacement/hr7lz32/

hr7ai0d,rvr3ic,"Yeah, the ankle replacements they have now last 20 years and I have a really good surgeon(Dr. Reach from CT Orthopedic Group based in Essex, CT, used to be part of Yale) and he honestly seemed like the replacement is the way to go, as it is modular and can just have new wear items swapped in later on. \n\nSo far I had 2 different bone grafts put in and both have ended in bone spurs eventually. Now I have a lot of tissue and cartilage damage from the spurs and I don't know if just taking the current spurs out will be a solution that will get me by for a long enough time to be worth it. My last surgery to remove the spurs and arthritis only gave me relief about 6 months and then it started acting up on me again. I currently have less than 10¬∞ of forward motion so my foot and knee are taking a beating making up for the tibia not moving correctly. \n\nThe replacement comes with a 6 week completely immobile and a lot of physical therapy afterwards which I would not be looking forward too. The other surgery option to clean up what's there, he said I will be walking next day.",1641296460,t1_hr79t03,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rvr3ic/ankle_replacement/hr7ai0d/
hrauoph,rvr3ic,"This is to GhostFour, I am a severe A since birth. Right ankle had synovitis which led to zero cartilage by the age of 21. Excruciating pain 24/7 to the point where I could not focus on anything but the pain. For two years, it took a toll on me mentally and physically. You can imagine the pain of two bones creating friction whenever you take a step.. i became 75% cripple as I could not walk. I spoke to my Hematologist who told me my options and fusion was the long term choice rather than short term, removing the synovium fluid. The problem with synovitis is that even if it is removed from the targeted joint, it will develop once again. That‚Äôs not to say it won‚Äôt develop again if you do fusion, no. It will develop but atleast with fusion being done, recovery for removing synovium fluid is extremely short. You‚Äôll be back up and about in a matter of days. \n\nI spoke to multiple orthopedic surgeons who specialize on the ankle and have done ankle fusion particularly, before. I also looked at the reviews they received before choosing my surgeon. Got my ankle fusion done June 2019. I am now 27 and it is January 2022. I can confidently tell you, Ankle Fusion which consists of ankle arthroscopy, removing the synovium fluid, and inserting two metal screws to fuse my ankle bone and metatarsal together was the best decision of my life. Changed my Quality of Life for the better. I can stand, walk through the city like I was a teenager with no foot issues, run (5 blocks till some pain starts to kick in), exercise and go about my daily activities with little to no pain. The only downside is that you will lose a few cm on the affected leg which will cause you to not walk completely normal but you get used to it. You won‚Äôt look like your limping unless you‚Äôve caused too much damage to your bone which will mean more shaving off during surgery. \nPain on somedays can be a 2 out of 10 rather than a 10 out of 10 which many of our own hemophiliacs are facing. At the age of 45, I believe you should get fusion done immediately. In about 10 years from now, we may need to redo it however, that depends on your lifestyle and such. Replacement should only be considered as the very last option. Do not delay as I did. I don‚Äôt want my brothers and sisters who have Hemophilia to ever face the excruciating pain of bone friction.

hr7i4zq,rvr3ic,"I've talked to a few people who have had fusion and they said it was the worst decision ever, and that is basically what my current condition is.

I now would be willing to have a second surgery if needed for revision than living with this useless piece of shit ankle that now has arthritis is another joint in just 6 months.

I‚Äôve been on prophy for probably 30 years now if you have any kind of an active lifestyle it‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense. When I was young I was constantly having random bleeds and bruises then I switched to prophy and have had hardly any since.

hqzj7n4,ru8lge,"Don't underestimate the impact of dosing frequency. I go on 2-3 week trips a few times a year (including domestic, international, and wilderness/backpacking type trips) and had similar refrigeration concerns before switching. This has turned out to be a total non-issue for me, and Hemlibra has actually been significantly better than my previous factor/Advate for traveling because most of the time **I don't need to bring any at all.**\n\nYour dosing frequency is up to your doctor of course, but for me it's every other week (on Friday), which means for most of my trips I do Hemlibra right before leaving and don't need to worry about it unless the trip is longer than 2 weeks. On the few times I've either had a 3 week trip or the timing has been unlucky where I leave for a trip on an off-week, I just need to bring one dose of Hemlibra for those 7 days in between, which doesn't need refrigeration.\n\nEven if I was to take a longer trip or had a really unlucky timing combination, one key thing to know about the 7 days without refrigeration is it's cumulative. Meaning you can take it out for 1 day while you're traveling, then put it in your hotel fridge for 2 days, then travel another day, etc. as long as it hasn't spent more than 7 total days out of the fridge before you use it.\n\nThe biggest portability downside of Hemlibra imo is that you still need to carry factor in case something major happened on your trip. But before a 3 week trip for me meant carrying 10+ factor prophy doses and a ton of supplies taking up half my backpack, and now it's just 1 dose that I never need to use, so there's really no comparison.",1641159344,t3_ru8lge,/r/Hemophilia/comments/ru8lge/portable_hemlibra_solutions/hqzj7n4/

I‚Äôm married to a man w severe hemophilia B who grew up with on demand treatment and switched to prophy maybe 6 years back. Honestly, he did it because his doctor suggested it and followed the regimen then which was one infusion a week. His drugs have changed over the last couple years and more recently he was switched to once every 10 days. Aside from the obvious benefit of having a constant level of factor circulating and therefore a reduction in spontaneous bleeding, the biggest difference we‚Äôve noticed is mental‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot less worry that you‚Äôll bleed or be in pain as a result of the bleed.

hpx14gw,rnzzj0,"I don‚Äòt think you have VWD, you just used most of your VWF to stop the bleeding. This exhausted your VWF levels to a point below normal range. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much, bleeding after surgery (especially tonsillectomy) is a common complication within the population.\n\nBut did you ever experience heavy bruising, long nose bleeds or a prolonged bleeding time after minor injuries? Also take a look at your family history, your hematologist will need this information in order to make a correct diagnosis.",1640441238,t3_rnzzj0,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rnzzj0/question_about_von_willebrand_disease/hpx14gw/
hpwc0vv,rnzzj0,"Maybe your level was low because you had used up all of your vwd factor trying to stop your tonsils from bleeding? I‚Äôm not sure it works that way, maybe look into it. I know if I (severe A, less than 1% factor 8) have two bleeds and infuse to 100%, that‚Äôs not 100% for each bleed, it‚Äôs 50% for each bleed. Because my body doesn‚Äôt make factor, so the factor I injected was used up. I would imagine if you make less factor than normal (and make it more slowly) and you have a surgery, then get your levels tested while you‚Äôre still recovering (bleeding) you will test low. You might test low even if you do make enough factor. But if you make less it makes sense that you would test low for longer. I‚Äôm not sure, but this is what makes sense to me. I am sure about the two bleeds taking more factor than one though. Hope this makes sense. Read it twice, it really does make sense to me and to some hemophilia professionals I know , and I bet most people don‚Äôt understand this. I know most new hematologists don‚Äôt consider it. Basically, if factor is made correctly by your body, it is able to stay at a pretty constant percentage. But as a hemophiliac the body doesn‚Äôt constantly maintain your factor level, so if you have had a recent bleed or are bleeding it is being used up. Depending on your bodies ability to make factor (which is determined by your factor level at baseline, if that can even be measured accurately). \nSo it sounds to me like you might not have vwd, because your baseline is normally around 150% or whatever you said. It makes sense it was low if taken while you‚Äôre tonsils were healing. \nThere could be many reasons you didn‚Äôt heal as quickly as usual, besides hemophilia or vwd. Maybe you‚Äôre low in iron, or we‚Äôre taking ibuprophen for pain relief? Or any other number of other reasons.  It doesn‚Äôt sound like vwd to me tho, unless the lab made a mistake. Which they often do. If you‚Äôre concerned I would suggest going to a hemophilia treatment center and seeing a hematologist who specializes in hemophilia. They will know the right tests to do and when to do them, to determine for sure. Otherwise, dealing with drs who don‚Äôt understand hemophilia, it‚Äôs really unlikely they can help you figure this out.",1640418996,t3_rnzzj0,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rnzzj0/question_about_von_willebrand_disease/hpwc0vv/
hthdt9i,rnzzj0,"hello! VWF fluctuates depending on time and other things, so you may test positive and then negative. This is completely normal with VWB. I would recommend testing 1 or 2 more times. It is possible you used all your factor while bleeding, and that is why your results were so low. It is also possible that your results were normal due to normal fluctuations. If you get a period, it is natural for it to be worse during that time. For me personally, I tested positive, then negative twice, and then positive again before I got my diagnosis.

I want to try and do a multiple day fast (trying to get to Autophagy which I think kicks in 3 to 5 days in...not sure I can do it but I didn't think I could go 36 hours once upon a time)  but I have to be mentally prepared for that.  No junk food, cut sugars as much as I can, [no sugar sodas](https://www.zevia.com/), no alcohol.  Low carb items, vegetables and meats cooked at home. Lots of water all the time. Something not quite Keto but close.  I do cut loose on the weekends but still limit to 2 meals and 18/6 eating pattern.\n\nUp until Covid, I fasted 36 hours, two times a week. Sunday night 7p to Tuesday morning 7a.  Tuesday night 7p to Thursday morning 7a.  I was at the gym 3 to 4 days a week.  Stationary bike, weight machines, swimming.  Since Covid I do yoga at home and walking. A real bike accident caused a jackpot a few years prior to the gym.  Torn and repaired quadracips tendon left leg. Ten days in the hospital and several months to recovery. Recovery led me to the gym and I really loved it.\n\nThis past June I had an ankle fusion due to dissipated cartilage, bone on bone pain.  It has been a great decision to get it done But 6 months of struggle. I can walk pain free now.  Doing as much as I can with having a job but try doing 10,000 steps several times a week.  My yoga routine, with weights at the end, runs about an hour.\n\nIf you have an IPhone, the Health App (standard, I believe) will track your steps.  There are specific male yoga workouts available online, I use youtube mostly to get the exercises I want to do.  These days I have a routine.  I have some free weights for the arms at the end of the routine.\n\n[This guy has lots of videos on food and health.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxLSxt2IKiQ&t=680s)\n\n[Here is just one example of Yoga for men.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzznoIsFsj8)\n\nThe one trick that works for me to do my workouts/walks when I am tired or don't feel like it is to tell myself I will do 5 minutes ONLY.

hnufrqb,rbyeda,"Swimming is pretty much hailed as the gold standard exercise for us bleeders, so its great you're doing that. Personally I loathe swimming. When it comes to exercise its always about finding something you enjoy and that works around your haemophilia. If you don't really enjoy it, you won't keep it up. Running is pretty high impact ofcourse, but walking is still a really good way to keep your cardiovascular fitness up and help get yourself in to a calorie deficit if you're looking to lose weight. Also, don't underestimate the benefit of strength and condition work... building your muscles will increase your metabolism, again aiding in weight loss over time. Also, since I started a proper gym routine, the benefit its had on my ankle joint pain is huge. Leg day is still possible, you just might need to adapt certain exercises to work within your restricted range of motion.  \n\n\nIn terms of diet, I moved away from specific ""types"" of dieting. I am trying to shed a few pounds atm, but I haven't done anything too drastic. It essentially comes down to calories out > calories in. A high protein diet is good for feeling fuller for longer. You'll be less likely to cave in to snacking (many of which are usually quite carb heavy). That said carbs aren't the enemy. When it comes to snacking, beef jerky and biltong are my saviours... just avoid the ones that have added a bunch of sugar.",1639053558,t3_rbyeda,/r/Hemophilia/comments/rbyeda/diet_and_exercise/hnufrqb/

hmyi2ka,r7cgc3,"Hi there!\n\nI have type 3 vWD severe, so while it's not Hemophilia, I am missing factor 8 on top of the Von Willebrand Factor so I tend to bleed like a severe hemo.\n\nI am based in Canada, so my care and treatment plan may be different to yours. I got my tonsils removed in 2014 when I was 27 years old. I was given a PICC line for quick access to factor. Before surgery, I was given a high dose of factor, surgery went well. I was given factor every 8 hours, on top of IV tranexamic acid.\n\nI stayed in the hospital for about 17 days. Everything was going well, but on day 9, the scabs began to fall off (as they should) and I began to hemorrhage. A second surgery was performed to stop the bleeding. I lost about 40% of my blood volume, and unfortunately I stopped breathing on the operating table. I was given chest compressions. The surgeon used a product called TISSEEL to help stop the bleeding. It saved my life.\n\nPost second surgery, I was given high doses of factor and tranexamic acid again. I also received a blood transfusion as I was fainting if I stood up. My pain was also managed very well, so it was definitely not my most painful experience.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you, I'm just being honest with my experience. I was well taken care of, but despite all the preparation, I was still left with medical PTSD. I have received therapy for it, so I feel like I've been able to manage it decently these days.\n\n[Here](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/124/21/5067/92472/Tonsillectomy-in-a-Patient-with-Type-3-Von) is a medical paper written about it from my hematologist's perspective.

Talk to a hemophilia treatment center and make sure your surgeon understands hemophilia and if you infuse properly you shouldn‚Äôt have any more problems than anyone else. Good luck.

I went into hospital to have my tonsils *and* adenoids removed. \n\nAfter the operation, the surgical wounds would not heal. The doctors were alarmed. I had three more operations to try to close the wounds, but they were ineffective. They telephoned my mother - we lived about an hour away from the hospital - to say that they thought she would want to come in and sit with me overnight because I might not survive it.\n\nAfter about three weeks, they operated on me a fifth time, and they took the risk of cauterising the wounds.

hm8zsmt,r375n4,"I'm not too familiar with specific NY or federal programs, but just wanted to say congrats on making this decision! I've wrestled with this decision many times in the past to leave the relative stability/security of a job with good insurance, whether it's to start my own company, take a sabbatical between jobs, ""retire"" early (FIRE), etc. It's something regular folks don't have to think about to nearly the same degree that we do.\n\nI did leverage COBRA for insurance for a little over a year to do my own thing between jobs about 7 years ago, and it was pretty straightforward but really pricey. So just make sure you know what your company is paying now and what you'd be on the hook for. I recommend timing your departure the first couple days of the month because you'll have insurance covered by your employer through the last day of that month, which both saves you a lot of money and gives you more time to set up COBRA/options.\n\nAs you likely know, COBRA can last for 18 months, although you might check if NY has any additional options there (e.g. California has Cal-COBRA which can kick in after COBRA expires for certain people). Personally once I hit a year on COBRA I felt the immediate urge to start interviewing again in case it took 6 months to find another job, so definitely felt like a ticking time bomb.\n\nAgain, not helpful for NY, but California has GHPP (‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãGenetically Handicapped Persons Program) which covers hemophilia-related medical expenses without private insurance -- perhaps NY has a similar program. Your HTC likely has (or should have) people very familiar with these programs, so they're another good place to start.

They're likely a better deal than COBRA which is always crazy expensive. \n\nSo NY state has their own health insurance website > [https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/)  \nIf you've ever heard about [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov), ""marketplace plans"", ACA, or Obamacare, this is that! You'll go through an application with some pretty basic stuff. When you put in your income, it'll also automatically pull in subsidies you're eligible for. It'll give you a bunch of plan options that are available in your area. It should let you add in your doctors and any meds you take to make sure they're in-network. If you decided to go for it, you'll also enroll in your coverage there. \n\nWith a $0 income, you can expect really high subsidies (or free - they'll show you Medicaid qualifications) for basic insurance. The plans all use a metal tier (bronze is for in case of emergency, silver is standard, gold is a little better, and platinum plans are really pricey but really good coverage). Personally, I go for really high premiums because if you're self-employed, you can expense the premiums pre-tax.\n\nThe benefits of going through the marketplace is they're all ACA compliant, which means you're protected and insured even if you have preexisting conditions like hemophilia.\n\nIf you want help navigating it, they can connect you to people who know the system to help make sure you're doing it right. I don't know as much about Medicaid / medicare but those navigators would likely be able to help you sort it out since they do a lot of work with low-income folks. \n\nOpen enrollment (the time every year when you can change your plan for next year) already ended, but quitting your job counts as a qualifying life event so you can still sign up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!",1638585194,t3_r375n4,/r/Hemophilia/comments/r375n4/insurance_access_for_unemployed_americans/hn5bokw/

If you want to give it a shot, there is something that I have used to manage really bad bleeds.  It' might be all in my head, but sometimes my partner will gently glide her fingertips over whatever is hurting, and that will put me straight to sleep.  It doesn't relieve the pain for long, but when I've been in pain for hours on end, it's enough relief to let me get to sleep.  I don't know why it works, but it seems to draw the focus away from the pain and focus on the tingling across the skin instead.  It is something my mother used to do when I was a child and had a bleed, and it has worked for me for almost 50 years.  Might be worth a shot.  \n\nI hope they start feeling better and that things get easier for them, and for you.  I know it can be an emotional hurricane to be with a hemophiliac and this we have to deal with, but people like you are  angels to us.",1637730714,t3_r0w103,/r/Hemophilia/comments/r0w103/please_help/hlv63yl/

I always had pretty heavy periods multiple times a month, and then at one point I had a period that lasted 215 days. At this point the only bleeding I ever experience was from my period and had no other indication that I had a bleeding disorder. I had no known family members that had a bleeding disorder, so I had no idea what was wrong with me. It took about a month and three doctors later to get diagnosed with Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease, because my blood test results kept coming back inconclusive. The easy bruising may be an iron deficiency.

The first haematologist just diagnosed a 'indifferent thrombocyte disease' (english is not my first language, I hope the translation ist right) and sended me back to my gyn who had no idea what to do. I finally researched myself, found an other haematologist and in the beginning he didn't think he could help, I never had nose bleedings, huge bruises and didn't seem to fit in the bleeding disorder schemes. But he checked my blood nevertheless (I reported my blood loss and that seemed to convince him) and he also checked my DNA. It was the DNA-test that proved I have VWD. My subtype seems to bei rare, at least my doctor greets me like ""oh you're that 2E"" kind of like an exotic animal when I see him. After the diagnosis, ist took about 2 more years until we found out what worked: no contraceptive pill anymore, tranexamic acid as soon as the bleeding starts.

hj4vfut,qhqk2h,"There are a lot of good YouTube tutorials on how to do it. My favorite way to make a knife is actually called "" stock removal"" which isn't the same to blacksmithing at all, but I do both. Essentially, instead of hammering out a rough shape with hot metal, you get a flat piece of bar stock in whatever metal you need, trace out your knife, use an angle grinder, jigsaw, or bandsaw ( the sawblade absolutely **must** be specifically made for cutting metal in opinion) and then you sand everything, and you file on some bevels. \n\nHandles are really cool. Basically if you make a full tang knife, you're just sandwiching a chunk of metal between two pieces of wood or whathave you. It's very worthwhile once you have gotten a hang of it. But it is unfortunately dangerous if you're not paying attention to safety. \n\nIf you want to get into blacksmithing, a small bit of advice:\n\nWhat you sacrifice in time spent, you save in cost. So you can go get a bunch of hand tools, and your little torch, and save a lot a lot of money, and it will take a very long time to make a good knife. I enjoy this a lot. \n\nOr you can spend thousands and thousands of dollars to make hundreds in a day, but I don't really enjoy this as much because it doesn't feel like I'm ** creating** something",1635938905,t1_hj2s2f4,/r/Hemophilia/comments/qhqk2h/anyone_have_motivational_stories/hj4vfut/

hibdtl8,qgvozx,"I went to a Catholic elementary school back in the early 80s.  Small, private school so everyone knew I was the ""fragile bleeder"" and I was treated as such.  I wasn't allowed to take PE or participate in any physical activities such as softball, kick-ball, field day events, etc... I was always the kid sitting on the sideline.  Meanwhile, I had a collection of exercises my physical therapist suggested I do to stay flexible and build up muscle to protect my joints and such.  And I had an evil, wicked stepmother that forced the exercises on me like some kind of punishment rather than being helpful or encouraging so I did them every single night.  Pushups, situps, pull-ups, stretches, etc...  Somehow eventually I signed up for Boy Scouts and of course half the scouts are my classmates.  One of the scout masters knows I'm new and wants to help me get a few quick and easy badges so he starts with the physical fitness badge.  He asks me how many push ups and sit ups I think I can do to record it in my scout manual and give me a badge.  He's not actually making me do the exercises, he's just taking my word.  One of my school mates overhears me say ""probably 50 or 60 sit ups"" and he has a fit.  He knows I'm the fragile boy from school that isn't allowed to do anything so of course he assumes I'm physically unable to do even a single sit up.  The scout master tries to calm things down, I tell the kid I can do more sit ups than him, and before you know it the whole troop is laying on the floor and we're having a sit up contest.  Most kids were done around 20-25 sit ups, a few make it a bit further but I'm the last one still going by 50.  I stop since I've obviously ""won"" and the kid that challenged me to begin with reminds me I said I could do ""50 or 60"" so I lie back down, tell the kid holding my ankles I'll finish without him, and I crank out another 50 before the place is going crazy and the scout master stops me.  Now I'm a legend the next week at school.  Word spreads and eventually at the end of the week, during PE a few of the scouts tell the PE teacher how I dominated this sit up contest in scouts and how I'm not fragile and I should be allowed to play.  I could tell the teacher felt bad having me sit out every class, game, event, etc... so it didn't take much to convince him.  He just tells me that if any other teacher shows up (highly unlikely) I should slip off the field because he could get into trouble and of course I agree.  We split into teams and my team was up at bat first.  I was standing 20-25 feet behind home plate, lined up in our assigned batting order when the our first batter took a monster swing.  She missed the ball, she kept spinning around a full 360 degrees like a bugs bunny cartoon, let go of the bat, and it flew through the air smashing me right in the knee.  My PE participation was over before it started.  I only ever got as far as being picked for a team and assigned a spot in the batting order before being carted off the field on a stretcher and taken to the hospital via ambulance with lights and siren blaring.  It didn't last long, but my bleeding disorder, wicked stepmother, and those miserable ass exercises I had to do conspired to make me a little legend for almost a week when I was in second grade.

I bruise easier now.

The thought of the pain... It was too much. \n\nMy view has changed substantially in the last 5 years. \n\nI married a single mom who just happened to be a high school crush. I had a kid. Thought I had managed to have my family without having to ""inflict someone with my condition."". Then she got pregnant. It was completely unplanned. And it scared the hell out of me. All those thoughts of pain and suffering came flooding in... \n\nAnd I gotta tell you... I wouldn't change a thing. I lovey daughters so much. Both my step daughter and my biological daughter are the literal reasons I press on through my own pain every day. My girls are my everything. \n\nSo what about my grandkids? Well, my daughter is an obligate carrier. 50/50 shot any male she bears will be a Hemophiliac. But I promise you this... They will NEVER suffer the ways I did. Unlike my own single mother... I do not require a hard education about doctors, about advocacy, about hemophilia. I can infuse. Both myself and others. I have what my mother did not have raising me. I have lessons I did not have growing up. IF my grandson happens to be a Hemophiliac I will be there in every single moment to advocate for his care. If I have to be the loaders voice in any room I will. That boys mother, my daughter, WILL have her concerns heard, specifically because I KNOW what the look on my mom's face was when they ignored her and I suffered. \n\nI can't say that I should or should not have had a child of my own...

Just remember that your body is the same it has always been, you just have a bit more information and understanding of it now. \n\nThere's a lot of genetics stuff I want to mention, but I don't want to overwhelm you too much.

hfn2i1i,q2p040,"This was taken from a newsletter I receive in Canada:\n\nVon Willebrand Disease: What makes it different from Hemophilia?  \nDr. Sara Israels,  MD FRCPC  \n  \nVon Willebrand Disease (VWD), the bleeding disorder with the unusual name, is much more common than hemophilia. However, unlike hemophilia, where men are affected far more frequently than women, the chance of inheriting VWD is the same for men and  women. BUT, women and girls are more likely to have bleeding problems because VWD can cause heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding after childbirth.  \n   \nVWD is named after Erik von Willebrand, a Finnish doctor who was the first to recognize that VWD was not hemophilia (he called it hereditary pseudo-hemophilia in 1926). It took another 50 years for us to understand what von Willebrand factor (VWF) does and how to measure it in the laboratory.  \n   \nHere are some other differences between hemophilia and VWD:\n\n  \nVWF is a very large protein that circulates in the blood and helps to stop bleeding by acting as the glue that sticks platelets together so that they can plug the hole in a damaged blood vessel. Clotting factors VIII and IX, which are low in hemophilia A and B, come along later in the process to form a mesh over the plug and keep the blood clot stable until the damage can heal.  \nPeople with hemophilia are more likely to have deep bleeding in muscles and joints.  People with VWD are more likely to have bruises, nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding. BUT, this is not an absolute: anyone with a bleeding disorder can bleed from any site, given the right circumstances.  \nMaking a diagnosis of hemophilia takes one blood test. Making a diagnosis of VWD takes several tests: one to measure the level of VWF, one to measure whether it is working properly, and one to measure its size. These tests are not simple. That is why people are sometimes asked to come back for a second or even a third round of testing, to sort things out.  \nVWF levels can be affected by many things including age, hormones, pregnancy and medications. So, someone‚Äôs VWF can vary over time depending on what else is happening to them. This is much less of an issue for clotting factors VIII and IX, in hemophilia.",1633548414,t3_q2p040,/r/Hemophilia/comments/q2p040/whats_the_difference_in_hemophilia_a_and_vwd_we/hfn2i1i/
hfmvcw0,q2p040,"The difference is which protein your body doesn‚Äôt produce/produces a non functional version of. For hemophilia A, you don‚Äôt make factor 8, while for VWD (for some patients at least) you are of course missing von Wilde brands factor. Those with hemophilia A can take replacement factor 8 and already have the VWD factor to complement it, so they are good to clot at that point. Those with VWD don‚Äôt have that protein, but because VWD and factor 8 travel in the blood together and VWD prevents the factor 8 from being metabolized, they also lack factor 8, as they don‚Äôt have the VWD to protect it. Thus, it is best to take VWD and factor 8 together to have all the required clotting factor .",1633545457,t3_q2p040,/r/Hemophilia/comments/q2p040/whats_the_difference_in_hemophilia_a_and_vwd_we/hfmvcw0/

Add to that the fact that the US pumped the brakes on research using fetal tissue decades ago, that has really slowed things down.\n\nA lot of pharmaceutical companies pivoted to the sub-q treatments we have now like hemlibra and the others I can't remember right now.

This antihemophilic factor was approved for commercial use in 1971 in the United States and was called Cryoprecipitated AHF. The plasma for hemophiliacs could be stored by blood banks. \n\nNow, we have subcutaneous shots that can be taken months apart for hemophilia treatment.\n\nThe overall hemophilia market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of 5.9%.

If you have a daughter, you are necessarily passing your X chromosome and the mother another X, so your daughter will have the gene as a carrier.

hctvivr,po49jn,"Hi bud. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm gonna tell you what you probably don‚Äôt want to hear, which is you shouldn‚Äôt play tackle football, full stop. \n\nGuys who don‚Äôt even have hemophilia sustain lifelong injuries to their knees, back, and head trauma that affects their cognitive abilities the rest of their lives. Very few who play in high school can play in college and even fewer go pro, and if they do they make far less money than other professional athletes. \n\nYou‚Äôre 17 so you‚Äôll graduate high school in a year or two depending on if you‚Äôre older or younger for your grade. It is NOT worth throwing away your lifelong health for a year or two of high school football. Sorry.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been playing baseball your whole life and you‚Äôre good and not sustaining injuries, keep with baseball, see if you can get a scholarship from it, and go from there. \n\nIf your reasons for wanting to play football are because of the fun of the game itself, check out other sports and see if there‚Äôs something similar or that also excites you. If it‚Äôs for the social aspect, there are definitely other activities you can do for a social outlet. And if it‚Äôs to be around the popular kids, just junk that because nobody is going to care who you went to high school with in two years anyway.\n\nEdit: adding that for what it‚Äôs worth, I would never allow my non hemophiliac son to play high school tackle football either, AND when I was in high school I also desperately wanted to play football and had to be told no by my dad.",1631632864,t3_po49jn,/r/Hemophilia/comments/po49jn/head_bleed_and_concussions/hctvivr/

You could ask to be involved in the coaching / managing aspect of it as well if you ask the coaches. There's other, safe ways to get involved!\n\nAnd the consequences of getting a head bleed could be death. My friends father went to sleep with a headache, it was a head bleed and he died.

hcv5dtb,po49jn,"I‚Äôm always one to say this: don‚Äôt let hemophilia stop you from doing what you love. But there are a few exceptions to this. Tackle football being one of them. Brain damage is too serious of an issue, and all it takes is one brain bleed that goes untreated for a few hours. This is almost sure to happen if you play football. At least to some extent. I hit my head pretty hard once and blacked out for a second, and when I woke up I did an infusion right away and went to the hospital and was admitted and stayed for two weeks to be sure I was ok. I didn‚Äôt suffer any brain damage from what I can tell, but my memory has never been the same. If I hadn‚Äôt infused right away I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve been screwed. It was really scary. People hit their head that hard all the time playing football. \nNot worth it, I promise. I have met too many guys with hemophilia who had small brain bleeds that went un noticed as kids and are mentally impaired now, and completely unable to talk or function normally. It‚Äôs a really sad thing. It‚Äôs just not worth the risk, and it‚Äôs almost certain to happen to some extent. I take a lot of risks myself, but never risks that I know have a definite negative outcome. You can do just about anything with hemophilia if you‚Äôre careful. But it‚Äôs impossible to play tackle football and be careful. Same goes for boxing. And being in the jackass crew.

AFTER my insurance co-pays and what not. \n\nStill though... Factor is never going to be affordable. Even at your cost examples. My prophy before Hemlibra was 6500iu 2/WK. 6500*.62*2 is $8060/WK. In all fairness clotting factor is absurdly difficult to produce and doesn't actually have that many of us to spread the cost out. It could be much cheaper than it is... But it will never be cheap. \n\nA much better example of how F'd the US healthcare system is is procedure costs and medications like insulin. Which CAN be very easily mass produced and is dirt cheap in most parts of the civilized world but is outrageously expensive here. Or the fact that two syringes, two needles, some iodine, some alcohol, some anesthetics and some steroids, combined with about 20 total seconds of fluoroscopy somehow cost 5 grand. Which my insurance generously (/s) covered all but 1.5k of. I mean stop to consider that even the 5k is the ""negotiated rate"" agreed to between the insurance and the hospital.

Also amicar was this stuff you‚Äôd take a spoonful of , it helped with mouth bleeds and nose bleeds. But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs around anymore either. Good luck!

A little bit of knowledge can be a lot more dangerous than a total lack of knowledge. Any good parent is going to want to protect their little boy or little girl from a life that can be wrought with trials, sources of anguish, things that a person may not *have* to deal with in their lives. It sounds like your parents care about you very much.\n\nYour parent's are not wrong, your boyfriends hemophilia **will** have an impact on your life at some point, or at multiple points, throughout the duration of your (hopefully lifelong) relationship.\n\nIt may impact decisions he makes, things he can/can't do, ways he can help around the house or raising children, or maybe even have an impact on your sex life. Not all the time, it sounds like he is pretty compliant with his meds, not every day or even every week, but it will happen. The thing is, you've already spent 2 years with him, gotten to know him and some of his habits and, thus far, it doesn't seem to have had a major impact on how you feel about him or how your life has been in his presence.\n\nI'm 35 years old. In my youth people (in the USA at least) didn't take their medication prophylactically. Insurance wouldn't cover it. This came about later, and it took me quite some time to become compliant. I'm sharing this to help you understand where I'm coming from when I comment. I'm not 100% even when I'm feeling my best. I still go to concerts, work long days, have fun with my friends, take vacations, etc. But I also will never go snow boarding, I've chosen to never have children (as a way to not pass on my gene), or avoid going to Disneyland (though I may just be using my disease as an excuse to avoid an explicitly unpleasant experience. I hate Disneyland...)\n\nBut you know what else? I would never begrudge my partner for wanting to go snowboarding. I'll happily sit in the lodge and day drink while she has fun with friends. If she wants kids? Let's talk adoption, or getting a donor. Ultimately it's about how he treats you, the compromises you both make, and building a life with both of your needs in mind.\n\nMy personal opinion? Educate your parents more. I hate to hear that you aren't speaking with your mother over this and, while it sounds like there may be some other problems they may have, education can help here better than anything else.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit - Added Hemophilia type and severity.",1630637406,t3_pgpurz,/r/Hemophilia/comments/pgpurz/deleted_by_user/hbeeayt/

I feel pain in my ankles even though i have no bleeding or anything.), i don't know yet if want to have kids because if it's a girl i will pass her my X chromosome, and a lot of other worries about the future that i won't say here because it is not relevant with the post.\n\nAll those things make me not want to start dedicated relationships because i don't want to make any girl have to carry my own problems.

hbecwwj,pgpurz,"Most doctors seem to know very little about hemophilia in my experience. Nothing against doctors but it's a specialized field that doesn't require their attention so they're nearly as ignorant as the general public.  It seems like they have other issues with your boyfriend and they're using this to try and separate you two.  Most people in my life have no idea I have hemophilia, even friends I've had for 20 years don't know.  Him not telling you right away is not unusual.  Once your relationship got serious he shared the information so I don't see that as a problem either.  Medical science is changing fast these days so concerns for you children (more accurately your grandchildren) are not really an issue in my opinion.  There are things to consider for yourself.  Your female children could possibly be carriers which means there's a chance their children could have hemophilia.  With modern treatment changing for the better and things like CRISPR, it's a non-issue in my opinion but something to consider long-term if you're considering children.  He's going to have some physical issues eventually which may lead to anything from a short temper/agitation to severe depression and anything in between.  Or maybe nothing that you would notice, and plenty of people without hemophilia have those and plenty of other issues.  I know I'm not the easiest person to get along with because of my physical discomfort but my wife seems able to handle it and she's been putting up with my nonsense for over 20 years now.  Nobody's perfect and as long as you're aware of what to expect, it's your life and your decision.  Life is hard and I'm sure your parents just want to help steer you towards the easiest path but you can't control your heart. I'm sorry they've put you in a situation where you have to choose one or the other but maybe educating them will help.  They'd probably do better to talk to a hematologist but there's plenty of information available online if they're interested in facts.  Your life partner is going to be the most important person in your life.  More than parents, siblings, and even your potential children so you can't let anyone dictate who you are or aren't with.

hbgjlwj,pgpurz,"It's truly amazing how much some people (even Medical Doctors) have no idea about Hemophilia. They haven't given blood transfusions for bleeds since probably the 60's or 70's lol. There's absolutely no reason to break up with this man because of the bleeding. You guys can live a fully functional and happy relationship. The only thing is that bleeding episodes can impede on everyday life, ruin planned events, or possibly even hospital stays depending on the severity of the bleeding. So you'll definitely have to ""accept that"" in order to be with him.   \nNow with current generation medicine, bleeding will more than likely become less and less common for hemophiliacs. My Hematologist started me on a new medicine called Hemlibra, and it's amazing thus far. I haven't bled since i started it a month or so ago.

They were under the impression that I wouldn't have a ""normal"" relationship, or be able to do ""normal"" things with him because of it. Yeah, he has bad days where we can't walk the dog together, or where I have to mow the yard because he should stay off his feet, but I don't think that makes us have less of a relationship. \n\nHe's always felt that his hemophilia doesn't define who he is or how he lives his life, and it's the same in our relationship. As long as he listens to his HTC team and does his meds when he should, it's basically the same as being in a relationship with someone who has a more common medical condition like high blood pressure - we're aware of it, but manage it with minor changes.\n\nI would suggest talking to your parents and asking them why they feel hemophilia makes him less worthy of a relationship.

hbd6vjd,pgpurz,Building on what was said above. Back in the 80's-90's during the AIDS crisis people with hemophilia still got treatment via blood transfusions and as a result many hemophiliacs were diseased because of it. (In Canada it is estimated that as many as 70% of hemophiliacs contracted Hepatitis C or HIV/AIDS). Since then treatment has transitioned to being nearly entirely synthetic and thus there is no longer a risk of contracting a disease via treatment.

I love skiing and we used to go on ski trips but we always knew he could only do 1-2 days max of activity and had to rest the third day. As we‚Äôve gotten older, we‚Äôve made a conscious decision to stop skiing.

I see you posted and discussed taking factor / hemlibra / inhibitors etc... and now you're asking where to even start with a bleed for your severe complex bleeding disorder as well as with almost no real information to go on (Severe Hemo A with a hot shin)... \n\nFirst off, I would very much recommend reading up on Hemophilia and general best practices laid out by Medical Professionals and if possible to see and talk to a Hemo Medical Professional as well.

From my experiences, heat and a straining feeling in a joint/area usually means the start of a bleed. When possible, I would Rest, Ice, Compress, Elevate as often as life allowed me to (with school/work etc...). If you have/can afford the medicine (factor/etc...) especially in severe patients it is always beneficial to start on medicine as soon as possible when you know you have a bleed. I would normally use the R.I.C.E. method above, use my minor Hemo medicine (DDAVP) right away and if the bleed progresses into the extreme category then take my major Hemo meds (Factor). \n\n\nAll in all though, I very much recommend visiting a Doctor/Medical Professional though to learn more.

haggmpe,pc50v4,"I am a moderate hemophiliac (Type A 6%) and did not have many serious bleeds in my younger years. I didn't know I had hemophilia until I got my wisdom teeth removed and kept bleeding despite all the stitches I received. It wasn't until senior year that repeated pressure and joint cracking over a year caused a bleed inside my left knee joint. What I am trying to say is that depending on your factor levels/ personal health/ age/ lifestyle, you may not suffer joint bleeds like more severe hemophiliacs do. I assume from all the excercise you do you are fairly fit and that protects you from bleeds as well. \n\nTo answer your second question about the police academy, I don't know how it is in South America but here in the states I believe having hemophilia exempts you from working in these careers due to the dangerous work environment. I would say sure, you could keep it a secret from your employers if this job is your dream but always keep in mind that if someone assaults you on the job and you get seriously injured it could become a life threatening situation and your department will likely find out about your condition anyways. \n\nMy best advice is be safe, put your health and well being first. There are other jobs in law enforcement with less impact on your body like detective work for example that you might like as well. Just keep your mind open to other possibilities but if policing is your true calling, then don't let your condition slow you down. Just be cautious and careful.

I too exercise frequently but still get bleeds even when giving Factor XIII. I do push ups, pull ups, bridges, lots of stretching but still manage to get a bleed in a joint. Maybe your factor levels are not reaching 0% after a few days depending on the half-life leading to you having little to no bleeds in your joints. It could also be you‚Äôve taken care of yourself by not getting injured as you only listed two bleeding issues.. Most Hemophiliacs suffer from thousands of bleeds from nose bleeds to getting hurt to getting into accidents all by the time they reach their mid 20s and it limits you from doing many extracurricular activities for the remainder of your life. To be more specific, I used to be able to lift weights on both arms normally. Up..down..up..down. Recently I‚Äôve had to stop weight lifting entirely. I‚Äôve discovered, each rep I do on my left arm, my elbow tissue tears and it hurts which will ultimately lead to a bleed. My left elbow is my second targeted joint which means its prone to facing inflammation. My right elbow however is flawless as it is part of my dominant arm and since I can remember.., my right arm has always been perfect. No bleeds ever.

What is your severity? Many hematologists actually suggest working out, swimming, and running as healthy and safe exercises.

Now I'm 35 and doing the math to balance funds enough to afford two shiny new ankle joints. I can barely walk. Unsupported my daily max is less than a mile. Total. I'm already on the max dose.of Celebrex and the Hemo and I are both hoping to get the ankles done before I start having GI issues. My legs hurt constantly. Walking or No walking. Anything beyond walking is a none option. Literally, If survival required running for more than 100ft I'd just be dead. Lol. Even just walking between a half mile and a mile results in serious to excruciating pain. Consider the long haul when choosing your hobbies. Aim for low impact, you'll thank yourself later. \n\nI do want to mention this just in general... \n\nThey've been doing studies about asymptomatic joint bleeding in Hemophiliacs for years. Now with Hemlibra they're even more curious how often damage from joint bleeding you don't even know you're experiencing occurs.  It's not information they have in abundance, but there is data to support the idea that even when you don't feel like you're bleeding you just might be bleeding a little anyways. And that little amount of bleeding can still do damage long term. Apparently, from what studies and articles I've read, a not insignificant number of our population has joint damage that does not line up with the amount of symptomization and known bleeding that has been documented.

Without gravity to stress them our bones weaken and deteriorate. Same thing with our vascular systems. Appropriate stress is essential to thrive. So you have to find a balance between exercise and excess stress. Weightlifting is ok, powerlifting probably not. Lol. Yoga is gonna be even better. It accomplishes most of what weightlifting accomplished while still being very rigorous and yet still low strain. Running? Bad idea. Biking? Much lower impact aerobic exercise. Finding the middle ground seems to be where it's at. And that's not to say that you CAN'T do those things. It's just that for us the potential cost and risks to our bodies is much greater than for a normal person. Can you ride a motorcycle? Absolutely. But you're much more likely to die if something goes wrong than the regular person might. Can you skydive? Sure, but special care to protect your ankles and knees should be taken, and I wouldn't recommend doing it weekly. Lol.

So he ordered the relevant parties to work toward making the UK self sufficient in blood products within a reasonable time scale. \n\nThen the government of which he was part was voted out and the new head of the department - either directly, or allowing those who were theoretically under his control - suspended that programme and parts of the UK carried on obtaining blood products from America.\n\nI was under the Haemophilia Centre in Cambridge, where all the blood products were obtained from the Blood Products Laboratory in Elstree (known as 'bpl', from their logo).

The combination of that and all the pot smoke blew my young mind! If you‚Äôve been to any of those meetings I bet we know some of the same people. I started avoiding everything hemophilia related in my 20‚Äôs tho, just bleeds were more than enough hemophilia for me to deal with. Plus the trauma of it all got to be too much I think. But now I work with people with hemophilia.  I‚Äôm making a living and I feel like it helps people. Which is amazing after years of my only option to have insurance and afford factor was to be on SSI disability, where they don‚Äôt allow you to own anything worth more than$2000 besides a car or a house or they kick you off.

ha8axxy,pay70o,"Hey brother, sorry to read about the troubles you're having. Please bare with me here. There's quite a few things to unpack, research, reference, and organize for you.\n\nOk, my assumption from your post is that your bleeding is directly related to menstrual bleeding and is not injury related. I'm gonna go forward from here with that assumption. If I'm wrong then I do absolutely apologize if I've just made you pointlessly uncomfortable. \n\nSo first... if NP is short for Nurse Practitioner let me start by saying that a N.P. should not be managing your hemophiliac care. They are amazingly skilled and educated individuals and I do not want to discredit them in any way... Having said that however our conditions are fairly rare and even most of the Hematologists in the world won't actually ever see a hemophiliac in a clinical setting. You really and truly need a Hematologist who specializes in our conditions. Hopefully you can find a Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) near you and get in to clinical care with a real hematologist. Many HTCs may also have resources and information for you, and even for your General Care Provider that can help them better treat you and your VWB. Many have specialists that they coordinate care with and those relationships will only benefit you as well. If you don't mind sharing a state or country location I'm certain someone, possibly even myself, can help you locate a Treatment Center near you.\n\nOk, next. As far as medications go... Full disclosure I have ZERO experience with medications such as lupron and danazol. Without knowing more I can't weigh in on these in any regard really. From what I'm reading I understand danazol is often prescribed to FtM individuals to suppress or completely stop menstruation as part of transition. If that's the reason you're taking it and you're having these kinds of issues with bleeding and cramping it's possible something is not going according to plan. I do want to say that I did find two references to Danazol and bleeding. The first is in a paper about the known interaction between Danazol and warfarin where it mentions that Danazol may have a direct but thus far unknown effect on coagulation systems in the body.¬π The second is in a paper specifically regarding hemophiliacs and Danazol where it notes that bleeding actually seemed to increase in 4 the 6 studied patients.¬≤  This seems to me to DEFINITELY be a thing to talk to a medical professional about. \n\nAs for the other medications you listed I see some issues, related and not related. Firstly, Midol contains an NSAID, chiefly Naproxen. Naproxen is both a Cox-1 and a Cox-2 inhibitor and has an effect on how we form platelets¬≥. This can significantly increase bleeding in individuals such as us. You're also taking Celecoxib and as far as I'm aware this should not be used in conjunction with any other NSAID. This combination should be discussed with a Hematologist. At an absolute MINIMUM have a conversation with a legitimate Pharmacist about complications. Both together could potentially DRASTICALLY increase your chance of gastrointestinal bleeding and that's an absolute nightmare scenario for us. Midol also contains acetaminophen. Tylenol is acetaminophen as well. Many people seem entirely unaware of precisely how dangerous Tylenol can be. It's metabolized almost exclusively in the liver and Tylenol over dosing can cause permanent, severe and even fatal liver damage. It's so easy to do in fact that the FDA recently forced a lowering of the labeled maximum daily dose from 8000mg to 6000mg to help prevent dangerous over consumption.‚Å¥ Acetaminophen is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the United States.‚Åµ \n\nUnfortunately like I said above without knowing where you are in transition or having a more complete picture of your current medical care I can't say too much. It's true that switching providers during a bleeding episode can be bad but if you're receiving ineffective care it may be necessary. It's also possible to call and obtain a consultation without actually switching your doctor completely. There are many options. But most important is that you get the care you need. It sounds like your current prophylactic regimen isn't cutting it man. It's entirely possible that you need additional dosing to combat episodic bleeding. As far as I know we all do. Especially in the face of this bleeding issue. I hate to say this because it can be such a sensitive subject but it's possible that if you aren't already you may need gynecological care as well. \n\nThe long and short of all of this is that you NEED to get in better contact with a GOOD and properly equipped provider. No one here can give you better advice than that. I'm happy to help you locate better care in any way I can. \n\n(Again, I'm terribly inexperienced with Trans people and trans issues. I support you, I do. I'm just very inexperienced. If I said or did something that made you uncomfortable, caused dysphoria, or was otherwise shit please let me know. (Or maybe direct me to a resource that might help me learn.) Lol.

ha3tzst,pa4tjt,"I don‚Äôt think there is any over the counter stuff. But any dr should be able to prescribe transexamic acid. It‚Äôs used for women with heavy periods so it should be easy to get. And it will help a little. Also, I would suggest not trying to do PT without infusing factor, unless it is helping you. But if it hurts , and you aren‚Äôt infusing or don‚Äôt know your levels , PT sounds like a bad idea. Normally for someone without a bleeding disorder it‚Äôs a different story. I‚Äôve had terrible outcomes from PT‚Äôs who aren‚Äôt trained in hemophilia. Even the ones who are, sometimes over do it. If you happen to be near Portland or San Francisco I could probably find someone who you could call and get in to see. Or if you‚Äôre in alaska or Hawaii.  Otherwise I would make an appointment with a hematologist and try to get a script for humate P. If your vwd levels are low, they‚Äôll be able to test, and then administer a dose to make sure you don‚Äôt react badly (which no one does). Then if you were to infuse weekly (again, depending on your levels) you can begin to heal. But if you‚Äôre low on vwd factor , and you‚Äôre illuopsoas, or any hip muscle, or anything at all for that matter is hurting and getting worse or not healing, you need to infuse and stay very still until you see improvement before trying to even walk or move around too much or anything physical. Sorry, but if you have vonwillibrands and a bleed this is the reality. It sucks, but it‚Äôs going to suck worse if you‚Äôre not able to get do this. It won‚Äôt get better on its own. I of coarse don‚Äôt know for sure, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre like the other people I know with vwd. It has taken a while for the medical community to catch up with the latest knowledge about vwd, so even most dr‚Äôs would have to read up on the latest protocols. But this is how we are treating vwd these days. It used to be they just let them bleed and keep going to the hospital. Now it seems to be more common to just infuse regularly. I have a 75 year old patient who is just awesome, and she has just learned to infuse herself, and has finally gotten on a schedule of profolactic infusions. She‚Äôs very active and not going to slow down, so she is just so happy that she can finally do all the stuff she wants to without having to slow down for bleeds. It‚Äôs cool to see her so happy about it. So don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll get there. She had as many similar problems in her life I‚Äôm sure. You know, I bet she would also love to talk to you about all of this if you ever wanted to. Anyways, good luck. Keep me posted if I can do anything to help. I‚Äôve been there. Right when I moved away to college when I was 20 I got a serious illiopsoas bleed and couldn‚Äôt walk for months. I was away from home and had no help but a bunch of partying college room mates. I just sat on a recliner in the living room day after day as the parties went on around me. It was awful. I hope you have some support, someone to get you stuff so you‚Äôre not trying to do everything alone. You need to stay off of your legs, if you‚Äôre anything like I was, that was the only thing I could do to keep the bleeding stopped.",1629767482,t1_ha3n8kt,/r/Hemophilia/comments/pa4tjt/what_level_of_hippsoas_pain_would_send_you_to_the/ha3tzst/

Once we got to US we went to a Hemophilia Treatment Center and got free medicines and this is where I met the PT. She helped me through a lot of exercises how to get back my strength on my right leg. I was same as you before very depressed that I thought I won't be able to walk anymore. We made the hip bleed heal first before doing any exercises. At first I still fall whenever I walk, right now I can run a little bit and walk for miles. The only problem is that you will still feel the numbness from your leg to your foot what I have mine until now. We are still figuring out on how we can also fix this. Don't lose hope.

h9mo3fn,p7pi85,"I've had multiple Psoas bleeds back in the early 2000's when i was in High School. I got my first one in about 1999 i think. I had been shoveling show (we live in west virginia), and the twisting motion of shoveling and throwing it is what pulled it. The bleed was so bad, i couldn't sleep at all, and the only pain relief i got was holding my thigh up to my chest with both arms. After going to the ER, they discovered via CT Scan that it was a psoas bleed, and I had a week long stay in the hospital with aggressive infusions to finally get over it. I had numbness in my knee cap area for years after that one!\n\nLater on, I had gotten another bleed in the Psoas while doing Marching Band. At our band camp i pulled it, and it bled for days and days, and i think required another hospital stay. \n\nThankfully, i started home infusing after those events. I'll never play around with psoas bleeds again. I'd recommend prophylaxis treatment to help prevent them if you're gonna be doing something with twisting motions like Golf or something like that. If you do get a Psoas bleed, treat it aggressively! do 100% doses every 8-12 hours! You can ""potentially"" die from bleeding into that muscle since it's so large (that's what my hematologist told me). \n\nHave a good day!",1629438021,t3_p7pi85,/r/Hemophilia/comments/p7pi85/deleted_by_user/h9mo3fn/

I have one of the most widely regarded orthopedic surgeons that works on hemophiliacs at my HTC and he was pretty blunt, the success rates at fixing elbows is generally low even in the non bleeder population, and even if they do you will have a LIFETIME weight lifting/holding limit of 5 lbs because the artificial replacement joint will pull out of the bone as it is a hanging limb. \n\nWhat I did end up having done to my elbow was that the ulnar nerve(funny bone) path had to get cleaned out because the bone damage was pinching the funny bone nerve and it would feel like that all the time or the pinky to ring finger and up my arm would go numb.\n\nI guess if you not already, get good at being able to tell if it‚Äôs nerve pain, inflammation pain, or hitting hard limits of bone obstruction pain.

h9dhp0p,p6h823,"If you can see a hemophilia trained physical therapist that would be super helpful. I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to hear this, but if you‚Äôre experiencing any pain, that‚Äôs too much IMO. Pain almost always equals a bleed. Unless you are absolutely certain it‚Äôs arthritis pain, and you can tell the exact moment when a bleed starts, any pain is too much. I recommend only weight training legs and core, and swim the rest of the time for upper body stuff. Elbow bleeds are the absolute worst, I feel for you. The only way I have ever been able to make progress (and I have, a great deal) is to spend the 6 months or whatever it takes to let all of the bleed resolve, until all of the swelling and pain is to where you know it‚Äôs the best it can be, until you have as much range of motion as you are capable of, then start really slowly. This is where the PT comes in. A good physical therapist, especially one who understands hemophilia can help more than anything else. They know so much about the body and how to gain muscle without causing injury.  If you can‚Äôt find one I seriously recommend putting down the weights and swimming. Even if you can‚Äôt swim, tread water, and use water weights. The gain may be slower in a perfect world, but it‚Äôll be faster when you consider that you won‚Äôt be set back 2 months every time you over due it.

Used to use small cans of food.\n\nJust prior to the pandemic, I enrolled in a gene therapy study.  I now have constant low levels of factor.  I also use to the last 1.5 years to exercise.  I can now curl 15 to 20lbs. I am able to do pushups again.\n\nYou have two issues: exercising your elbow and excersing the rest of your body.  Should look into brace for elbow.  I had a custom neoprene brace that had two metal hinges along the side.  It also had pins in the hinges  that could restrict the range of movement.   Something like this might help to support your elbow so you can do shoulder exercise your shoulder.\n\nFor your elbow, it will be slow going.  Make sure you infuse and just move it through its range.  No weights.  Use resistance bands instead of weights.  Weights put force on the joint where bands won't. Ice it as well.  There isn't a lot of tissue surrounding the joint so icing will work reduce the pain.  It will be Slow.  Don't give up.\n\nAnd as others have suggested, talk to a physiotherapist which specializes in Hemophilia.

Some water resistance exercise like at a pool that reduces impact on the joints. It's boring, and feels a little lame, but it works.\n\n3. Low weight, and slowly increase reps. Sometimes if I'm feeling extra cautious, instead of weights, I use resistance rubber bands for some exercises. It's sucks having to do more reps with low weight/bands, but it's so much safer. \n\n4. Yoga, I know... but yoga is great for stretching out those muscles. I kept getting a bleed in my arm, that turned out to be caused by my shoulder and neck muscles being too tight.

I live in Nashville and go to Vanderbilt for my hemophilia so we talked to them as well.\n\nEmory seemed like a good fit. The surgeon wanted to do it robotically and seemed very capable, but had never worked with hemophilia.\nVanderbilt has worked with hemophiliacs, but didn't seem to have a solid plan for the surgery.\nCleveland clinic refused to do the surgery and recommended a mitral clip instead. A mitral clip doesn't 100% solve the problem and is usually used with geriatrics. I'm 43. So that guy is basically only taking the easy cases so his numbers look good.\nNew York seems to have a decent hematologist and they have the top surgeon in the country.

I figured if I was ever in a situation where I needed surgery, I'd just tell them to get me up to 100% from my current ~35-45%.

h7wvevb,oyn6y6,"Hello again, \n\nI am very happy you made some progress on your diet and body. Keep it up.\n\nNow, on what has to do with lifting dumbbells. I have been lifting dumbbells for 6-7 years. i never ever had a single bleeding from it even when i would lift 8-9kg (wrong move i know,it only happened for like a month and i have reduced it to half since then). But you might assume that this is only thanks to always having been on prophylaxis. Well in my opinion there are a couple of other reasons why i have been doing it successfully so here's a couple of things that you should keep in mind:\n\n1. Make sure that you lift very light weights ( at least in the beginning). Ideally you want to feel your arms a bit tired towards the end of the last set ( Last few reps of your exercise).\n2. PLEASE make sure that you are doing the exercise CORRECTLY. Go to someone who is a trainer or someone with experience. It is very important to not put a lot of pressure on your elbow and wrist.\n\nSo i have always had in mind number1 for avoiding muscle/sinew bleedings, and number2 for avoiding joint bleedings.\n\nI don't have huge biceps and triceps and i would be twice as strong after all these years of exercising if i didn't suffer from hemophilia. But i have managed to keep my bleedings from it at 0 and i still have some very nice and strong biceps/triceps (People can tell i am working out). Last but not least, the veins in my arms are popping out all the time which is super helpful for when injecting. \n\nI hope i helped a bit.",1628238266,t3_oyn6y6,/r/Hemophilia/comments/oyn6y6/hey_guy_i_need_a_bit_of_help_2/h7wvevb/

h7tvrk6,oymhsb,"yes it is a good thing to take. it is a non steroidal anti inflammatory (nsaid). another examples of nsaids is advil. many nsaids have a side effect of thinning blood or affecting clotting in some other way, which is why we can't take them. celebrex however does not work like this and is fine for hemophiliacs. it does not work like painkillers though where you feel pain, take it, and get some relief. for celebrex to work properly, it's levels need to be built up in your system over time, similar to antidepressants. i took celebrex for years and can attest it is very helpful. you won't really notice any effects though while you're on it. its more that after you're on in for a while, if you stop taking it you will notice your pain levels go up. so it is important to stay on a schedule with it and take it consistently. \n\ni should probably get a new script for it now that i think about it.",1628183505,t3_oymhsb,/r/Hemophilia/comments/oymhsb/celebrex_for_joint_pain/h7tvrk6/

h7u0ddc,oymhsb,"Yes, as another poster said, it is prescribed for us because it has a lower effect on platelets than other NSAIDs (I believe that is correct, but if someone knows better, feel free to correct me). So, I have been taking it for years. Like some of the other Cox2 inhibitor NSAIDs, it had some concern about cardiac issues. But where Vioxx got banned, Celebrex has stayed on the market.  I will say, I felt no benefit at 100mg and had to go to 200mg.  And even at that, I don't think it works as well as a couple of Advil. But Advil and Alleve can really do a number on your stomach lining if you take them regularly.  My brother got a bleeding ulcer from taking Naproxen (which is the drug name for Alleve).  So, I take Celebrex pretty much daily. But if I have a really challenging day where I have to keep going, I will take a couple of Advil.  The Cox 2 NSAIDs were Pharmas attempt to reduce the effect of NSAIDs on the stomach. But in general it didn't work out well, since some of them seemed to cause heart problems.

h7u88th,oymhsb,"To answer the what is it? Celebrex is a Selective Cox-2 Inhibitor and a Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory drug much like Naproxen or Ibuprofen. However, unlike Ibuprofen and Naproxen, both of which also inhibit the Cox-1enzyme which can effect platelet formation and clotting action, Celebrex ONLY inhibits the Cox-2 enzyme and thus does not effect clotting. \n\nAs for the anecdotal information? I have two end stage ankles. I am rather disabled at current and am trying to organize time to replace both of my talo-tibial joints with total ankle arthroplasty. I ALWAYS have pain walking. However, without a constant dosage of anti-inflammatory medication I quickly lose the ability to walk all together. Celebrex is very effective for me. Especially when taken alongside Acetaminophen/Paracetamol. It has given me back the ability to walk by and large. \n\nAs for concerns and side effects? Your doctor will have already weighed you options and decided the risks are worth it. But If you want to know more then I encourage you to do a bit of independent research. Celebrex does have a risk of causing ulceration in the stomach and upper small intestine. Also, there has been at least one Selective Cox-2 Inhibitor recall from the market. Very very seriously do NOT take more than prescribed and I would say never EVER take without food in your stomach. I would research and become familiar with the signs and symptoms of stomach and intestinal ulcers. These can be especially dangerous for us as bleeders but if you pay attention to your body and don't act stubbornly about symptoms you should be fine. Again, like every medication it has its risks. Your medical provider will have weighed that risk against your current health and pain management needs. But do definitely follow the directions and talk to your doctor about concerns. The more you know, the better.\n\nEdit: I should have added that it does not work like a typical pain killer or an opiate. It is not fast acting. It performs best over time. Endeavor to take doses on time and not miss doses. It will work the best for you that way. If I forget a dose it can take 12-36 hours to get back the full benefit.",1628188559,t3_oymhsb,/r/Hemophilia/comments/oymhsb/celebrex_for_joint_pain/h7u88th/
