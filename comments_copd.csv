i6g1e83,udcgy7,Sorry to hear that.\n\nCOPD is incredibly variable to be honest and no doctor is going to tell someone that they have roughly 5 years to live. Why would they even say/try to predict that?\n\nIt's very possible your dad misheard/misunderstood what was being said and I'd advise you to go with him to the next appointment if you can to set things straight.\n\nHis survival depends on how much his lung function and physical capabilities decline year on year and no one can predict that or tell you how fast/slow that might be.

To diagnose COPD, the very first condition that needs to be met is that your FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70.

i5upe4g,u9x6t0,You never provided the % predicted values for TLC and RV. Those could be normal for you for all I know.\n\nThe commonest cause of air trapping in your age is asthma. You may not have symptoms with asthma. The normal DLCO almost proves it's asthma and not emphysema. Normal FEF values make asthma less likely if you have those. \n\nWhy would it be a faulty test? It's just measuring your effort. So if you followed their instructions then I'd take it as real especially if it was done in one of the proper plethysmography boxes. If you didn't follow their instruction during the test and got an abnormal result then that's on you to figure out really.\n\nFor peace of mind get spirometry with a bronchodilator response done if you can.

i5l3fto,u8dwsh,I think at this point multiple people have told you that it is exceedingly unlikely that you have emphysema including doctors on here in addition to your own actual doctor.\n\nEmphysema can cause literally any degree of limitation from no limitation (marathons) to severe limitation (breathless at rest). Having emphysema does not predicts breathlessness. \n\nEven if you think it is missed it changes literally nothing. You still can only exercise as much as your fitness allows. You need to stop smoking completely (including weed). It's all smoke and its all going to give you emphysema eventually.

i58ojth,u6jqhk,How has the doctor dismissed your welfare? I'm sure they have advised you to quit smoking which would be the only corrective measure beyond possibly putting you on an inhaler for the breathlessness you've described. \n\nThe bottom line is that hyperinflation and emphysema can be overcalled on CT scan due to CT scanning equipment being so high resolution nowadays. The radiologist report can also be swayed by the Physician's request in the CT. They may have said you were a heavy smoker this time which could have prompted the radiologist to pay attention for subtle emphysema. \n\nBiapical scarring is also found in healthy people.\n\nThe alternative is that you have indeed developed early emphysema. You've always known the corrective measure (stop smoking by any means possible). The onus is on you to stop. \n\nEmphysema is a feature that can be seen in COPD. You can have COPD with or without emphysema. You can also have emphysema with or without COPD. \n\nTo prove you have hyperinflation you could ask for volumes as part of your PFTs (you should get these at least once as you're likely to have COPD). Spirometry and diffusion can assess the extent of emphysema if you're looking for further assessment.\n\nEither way treatment of COPD is generally dictated by your degree of symptoms and your exacerbation rate/severity and is guided by the GOLD guidelines. CT scans don't matter for treatment.,1650307085,t3_u6jqhk,/r/COPD/comments/u6jqhk/at_a_lost_copdemphysema/i58ojth/
i5bmibr,u6jqhk,"First off, COPD is an umbrella term that includes Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis. A person can have just one of these conditions or both.Either way, you have COPD. \n\nCT scanning of lung nodules use low dose radiation as nodules can be missed at the regular doses. Insist to your doctor that you want a regular chest xray series to see how inflated your lungs are and demand a pulmonary function test.\n\nSince you've already quit smoking, I hope, you've already are ahead of the game. Once all your results are in you'll know for sure what the issues are. Smoking for 40 years means you probably have Emphysema. After the LFT and x-rays results you'll be offered the best treatment for your stage of Emphysema. New treatments are available for Emphysema but the best treatment is self-care to avoid triggers. Good luck!\n\nP.S. I have Stage 4, Vey severe Emphysema, 20% Lung function.

i58vrse,u6jqhk,"I guess maybe being dismissed may not be the right way to word it. And I have quit smoking prior to this scan.

It's normally used by people angling for suing for malpractice and on reading your post history, you don't come across like that at all. \n\nWhile I agree that doctors should explain your ct results to you (in broad terms), I don't think they genuinely have the time to go through every incidental thing that was picked up. It's up to them to tell you what is relevant. That's quite literally their job. If they don't disclose something that was later significant, then sure, you can sue them etc. As they fell short of their responsibility. If people want more time with doctors then more doctors will need to be trained and hired. \n\nThere's also a really good chance a patient is going to misconstrue or pick up what the doctor said incorrectly due to not understanding the language (as you said) and having a large volume of this language being thrown at you in a short time period. (doctors have others to see who want to know as much about their condition as you do). \n\nI know you know all this as you come across as conscientious but it still needs to be said for those who don't realise this.\n\nGoing for the further tests I mentioned still stands and I'd encourage you to ask for them.\n\nHopefully, ultimately, you find something that characterises and works for you personally.",1650321465,t1_i58vrse,/r/COPD/comments/u6jqhk/at_a_lost_copdemphysema/i59mpae/

(walked 1mile or so). i also think i have gerd and thats common with copd. i went to see a dr about all of this and she used a stethoscope on me and told me i was fine within 5 minutes of me being there and sent me on my way, but i dont think you can detect emphysema with a stethoscope especially this early on. also i‚Äôm always getting sleepy during the daytime recently, and i have a dry cough that didnt go away after quitting smoking. i rly don‚Äôt know what to do",1650524097,t3_u63yso,/r/COPD/comments/u63yso/emphysema_at_23/i5l69l0/

i5sowus,u63yso,"You‚Äôve explained a lot of how I feel/felt. \nSo I can speak with experience.\nI‚Äôm 26 and am diagnosed with Emphysema nearly 3 years ago, this is rare but even more rare that I have had the opportunity to address it. Many people aren‚Äôt so lucky. as you can imagine this made my health anxiety go crazy and I worried about everything.\n\nI smoked since the age of 16, 6-9 joints a day sometimes mixed with tobacco and cigarettes too.\nMy case is extremely mild, like the absolute very start of it. Now, i can‚Äôt barely find anyone in the same experience as me, that‚Äôs because its very rare.\n\nYour resting rate is a little high but within normal range of a healthy person, so it may be elevated due to anxiety or being de-conditioned. 1/4 mile is great for a first go (I vomited) but I reckon you can get to 2 miles within 2-3 weeks! Try it, you‚Äôll feel so much better I guarantee, exercise or walking outdoors its amazing for mental health. \n\nWith the time you‚Äôve smoked I highly doubt you have Emphysema or any COPD. I felt breathless after my diagnosis, this was due to Anxiety. At mild, which if you did have it you be Mild, you would not feel it at your age, which is why i don‚Äôt think you have it. If your FEV1/FVC levels are good, don‚Äôt worry.\nAnxiety is powerful I have learnt, you become super aware of everything going on in your body, if it be pain, phlegm, breathing, heart etc etc.\nThis all has a major effect on your body.\n\nI have the same problem with breathing as you, I often go to myself and think ‚Äúam i going to get out of breathe?‚Äù I then breathe differently and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm short of breathe but yet I can run for a while. Now again when I walked a 6 mile walk with my friend I didn‚Äôt because my mind was pre-occupied with something else.\n\nI hated it when people tell me what I was going through was Anxiety. Because I was so dead set on there being more of a problem I often ignored them, read research papers and got myself in a bit of a pit, this isn‚Äôt to say that doctors are always right, but in this case your FEV1 is fine, and if it wasn‚Äôt a good result you would feel out of breathe, these machines are accurate and if you haven‚Äôt got other symptoms of COPD, do not panic!\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until I did what you did which was exercise I managed to get over it, it takes more than one positive habit to get over all the bad. Keep up with exercising to reinforce that ‚ÄúI can run without getting out of breathe‚Äù and you‚Äôll notice your anxiety will fade with time if that is the case.\n\nCBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) works wonders! You don‚Äôt need to go to a therapist, just look online about it and how it helps with Health Anxiety, there are many good tips about training your brain to think more logically and positively on things while reserving time to concentrate on what worries you freeing up time for happy thoughts.\n\nSorry for the Essay, but I wanted you to know Anxiety and worrying about symptoms can really make it feel real and makes any logic go out of the window.\n\nThink about these things -\n\n-Most people are 40+ when symptoms start showing.\n-It‚Äôs extremely rare for young people to have COPD.\n-People who are young often have AATD of PiZZ, a lot of these people have liver problems as children, and have COPD/Liver problems in the Family.\n-If you can run and not feel like your wheezing, you‚Äôre okay! It‚Äôs normally to feel out of breathe, its not normal to feel like you‚Äôre going to pass out after exercising.\n-Think of what‚Äôs more likely COPD or Anxiety?\n\nWhen you get a bad feeling about what your perceived condition, think about it logically, debunk your negative thoughts, do this enough and you‚Äôll find the thought‚Äôs will go. Your heart will lower and your breathing will ease.\n\nIf you have any questions about My experience of Anxiety, COPD or just to talk about it generally, please pop up!\n\nEdit: Sorry about the huge essay, but i think my experience may help you.",1650660270,t1_i5kgplb,/r/COPD/comments/u63yso/emphysema_at_23/i5sowus/

Beyond that, you can increase your chances of a long and comfortable life by doing everything you can to strengthen your lungs: Do all the cardio you're able to no matter what your limit is.

You‚Äôll be fine either way.\n\nMoral of the story, don't assume you have something chronic if you can't know for sure, realise what you've done is great, and you‚Äôll be fine because of it.\nWorrying about COPD wether is be worrying if it‚Äôll progress or worrying if you have it is not a nice pit.\n\nConcentrate what you've done right and not what could be there.\nYour spirometry is fine, take your symptoms as a warning about what could've been.\n\nCOPD is very common, it could be as many as 40%, but a lot of smokers never get tested and most don't progress to a late stage, they die of what come with old age or something else.\nAnd a huge majority of smokers who quit at a early stage never get to a late stage.\n\nSorry for the long reply, but you seem worried and I feel like my experience can try and help you think more logically about it, I've read many research papers and this is where I'm at with it all. I don't want to be one of them who say ‚Äúits just anxiety‚Äù but even if anxiety isn't the cause to your symptoms, anxiety does make it a whole lot worse and often make you not think logically about everything.\nEspecially in the case of COPD where it‚Äôs so common, people often overestimate how fast these things progress if at all if you quit.",1647813286,t1_i1gab3e,/r/COPD/comments/tip3kb/spirometry_88_says_no_asthma_normal_chest_x_ray/i1gf5xc/

i1f79tf,tij87c,"I have some input. Recently since Covid  started being a thing in 2020 for unknown reasons at the time I thought I was experiencing long haul Covid symptoms. I had tight chest, bouts of shortness of breath every day, I also experienced this sensation where I felt like I was going to pass out from getting too much oxygen but having intense shortness of breath episodes and I thought my dumbass had smoked myself into copd problems too. Anyways long story short I did not have covid or copd but rather I was experiencing extreme reactions from food allergies I had recently developed. I developed 2 separate food allergies. (Wheat and dairy.) around the same time and during all the Covid shutdown freak outs so I went undiagnosed for almost 5 months. It was horrible to breathe and most times I thought I was going to pass out it was so confusing. \n\nTurns out according to my pulminologist that there is just a layer of tissue that separates our lung tube from our swallowing tube and when the agitation is really bad in your esophageal tube it can actually make your breathing tube also inflamed. This is a hard lesson to understand when you have no medical reassurance maybe you don‚Äôt have copd but rather maybe you developed an unlucky food allergy. \n\nMy symptoms are that my chest feels tight all the time but I feel like my exhale and inhale are weak. My chest will consistently stay tight for a full 2 days after I‚Äôve stayed away from my food allergy trigger so it was hard to even know that it was coming from food. By day 3 if I completely avoid the allergy trigger I will still feel like there‚Äôs a spot in my lungs that is blocked or rather like a spot where it‚Äôs still uncomfortable. By day 5 my symptoms are finally gone and my need for my inhaler subsides. The problem with food allergies is that sometimes you don‚Äôt even know what is triggering it unless you actually get tested because it can take hours to initiate the allergic response and the side effect of the allergic response can last days( for me) so it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint. \n\nLong story short. If your doc already said your lungs are good it could be what I‚Äôm going through.  \n\nI also felt like I had Covid and when I didn‚Äôt I thought i had developed copd symptoms and when they said it was unlikely I thought maybe it was cancer but X-rays said no. Maybe this will help. \n\nMind you wheat and dairy is in almost everything we eat. So when I was eating I was unknowingly eating every day triggering my symptoms for about 5 months before I even figured it out.",1647794930,t3_tij87c,/r/COPD/comments/tij87c/scared_i_have_copd/i1f79tf/

i0asw69,tbsrj5,"You sound quite similar to me now you write it all out. Obviously with some differences too. I‚Äôll try to reply to your comments separately but for me to be as brief as possible: \n\n- Nov 2019 noticed blood in my spit for first time. \n- Chest X-ray fine. Went on anti depressants at same time for other reasons \n- Came off anti depressants in March 2020. \n- Since then I‚Äôve continued to go through phases of seeing blood in spit. Usually in morning time. Or sometimes if I create suction and spit a few times it appears (a normal person not looking for it wouldn‚Äôt notice this). Sometimes I go over a month not noticing it. And it is only a small amount btw, not loads. But anyway that‚Äôs symptom 1.\n\n- Jan 2021 I began to feel a slight chest tightness and heart burn. Also noticed on sharp inclines I‚Äôd feel short of breath. Never so bad I need to stop but I certainly feel it. Plus I‚Äôm not exactly hiking mountains either, the thought makes me anxious. For comparison though I walked around 50 miles in 4 days a couple of weeks ago mostly on flat ground. So I feel my shortness of breath has a link to exertion.\n- I also frequently clear mucus. Again it sort of does phases in terms of how bad it is. Never too annoying. Just that I feel something in my throat and clear it and spit out a bit of mucus which can have a brown tone too at times. \n- Defo have health anxiety like yourself where I‚Äôm looking for symptoms I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily otherwise notice or get that fixated over. And I think the lack of diagnosis contributes to this. \n- I burp a lot but particularly with activity I‚Äôve noticed. \n- I‚Äôve started snoring louder according to my gf\n- When I force an exhale I do get a slight wheeze. Plus at night time in bed I notice I sometimes wheeze on inhale and exhale. Not loudly just very feint and a cough usually clears it.\n- That wet cough gurgling I get too at times. \n- Blocked sinuses for years like you\n- Spring 2021 began to notice a very faint ache. More just a feeling. Just below the left breast but on the back near the flank. No pain at all just a feeling that comes and goes. Notice it leaning forward sometimes but very acute and minor\n- Occasional left sided chest very slight ache and left shoulder slight ache. Again both usually quite mild.\n- Sometimes I‚Äôd get like neck pain which will last a couple weeks and go. \n- Noticed I‚Äôve got foamy urine at times but never if I sit down and urinate. \n- Hesrtburn at times in the centre of my chest nearly like we‚Äôre my throat meets my stomach. \n- And as of my booster vaccine a lump in my left armpit which comes and goes. Presume it‚Äôs a swollen node and only started end of December.\n\nTests done for me: \n\n2 chest x ray clear, ecg was told was clear (but there was defo a note about a sinus wave), d dimmer fine, complete blood count fine x3, diabetes test, liver blood tests fine, kidney blood tests fine, thyroid tests fine, gluten intolerance fine, spirometery fine, 2x urinalysis fine. Probably a couple other I can‚Äôt remember.\n\nMy bottom reading of my blood pressure was slightly elevated at my last 2 visits in November. So I did a 24 hour blood pressure monitor which apparently came back fine. So could have been anxiety related \n\n\nOther random things;\n\n- Slight IBS I think\n- get like random small painless blisters on my ring finger which flare up and come and go. \n- Night eating syndrome where I have this compulsion to wake up and eat something in middle of night at least half the week. \n- Slight blurry vision at times again very mild though (I do have suspected kereteconus and have been awaiting an appointment for 3 years so probably related to this) \n- A dripping sound sometimes when lying down from chest area \n\n\n\nI feel when I go to the doctors that I just get told I‚Äôm fit and healthy and minimum tests so nearly avoid it. \nI still get up and work 5 days a week and do my shit, nothing is crippling or like major. It‚Äôs just a load of random minor symptoms I‚Äôve noticed the last 2 to 3 years. \n\nI don‚Äôt doubt either that some of the symptoms are directly related and heightened by anxiety. As everything started in the airways I do think my issues relate to this area in some way. \n\nI‚Äôve read of people with hiatal hernias and gastritis having these symptoms and maybe not other more common ones so maybe this. \n\nIf not then I think maybe something sinus or esophogus related. If you dig enough there are some random things out there. \n\nIf not that then I‚Äôd look at my heat next due to that ecg before. Even though I was told it was ok, it did mention something, so I‚Äôd want to explore this next. \n\nAutoimmune conditions and vasculitis another wildcard cause. Or even like hepatitis b. \n\nLiver or kidney disease or under active thyroid too. Even gallbladder related illness (although this usually impacts other side) or even a lung disease too.\n\nA latent version of like walking pneumonia maybe? Or some infection. Long covid possibly?  AGPA even too\n\nI find the less I think about it the better I feel. And if anything I feel it‚Äôs more a warning sign for me to make changes which I‚Äôm trying to do. \n\nI do wish a doctor would take me more seriously too though for peace of mind. \n\n\nI did a lot of reading on COPD though and everything talks about the spirometry. I didn‚Äôt even do the test with an inhaler because my score was well above the limit and that‚Äôs with wheezing on forced exhale too. So as that‚Äôs the main method of diagnosis it can‚Äôt be this. \n\nIf it was something sinister like cancer I‚Äôd expect to be worse by now and also to have lost weight. \n\n\nAll I know is whatever is going on isn‚Äôt killing me quickly. And I don‚Äôt have enough faith in health care system for a diagnosis either. So just trying to do what I can do at home to improve myself and also not over thinking this either as I feel the more I think about it the worse I feel symptom wise.\n\nSorry for the rant!!",1647038160,t1_i0ancms,/r/COPD/comments/tbsrj5/what_is_the_possibility_for_copd_of_a_young_30—Éo/i0asw69/
i0av6i6,tbsrj5,"If I were you I‚Äôd look at maybe trying to keep a diary for a few weeks. I know it‚Äôs a hassle but if you‚Äôre getting nowhere with the doctors it might help you identify trends or triggers yourself.\n\nI don‚Äôt doubt at all that gastritis could be affecting your breathing, I‚Äôve read some people mention it. Hiatal hernia can also do this too.\n\nOne interesting study I read about lung diseases is that something like 80% of patients also have acid reflux. For me this makes me think that acid can be causing lung damage. And I think that‚Äôs maybe also why symptoms are intermittent. \n\nI‚Äôd research diet changes you can try to accommodate too. Within reason though too where you‚Äôre still happy because mental health is also important!! \n\nThere is a YouTube video of a guy who talks about acid reflux and he makes some concussion with baking soda which he squirts in his throat and nose. A lot of people with acid reflux speak highly of this. If you search most popular posts on acid reflux or LPR subreddits you will find it. Try it! \n\nTry not too eat or drink too soon before bed. And make sure to sleep on your side with head elevated if you can. This will help prevent acid going up your throat and into your airways. I think facing left is best but not sure.

In June he ended up in the hospital with afib, heart attack, stroke, and severe pneumonia. He spent 11 days in the hospital and ended up going on hospice to go home. Long long story short he is off hospice now and trying to recover the best he can. He was bedridden and in a wheelchair for awhile. He is back to walking and now is exercising nearly every day. Very short walks and he has a peddler. He still gets very winded walking around. He is also very depressed that he can‚Äôt breathe as well as he used to. His O2 is usually around 93-96. The doctors say to keep moving and he will get better walking and breathing. Breathing exercises help however he is not good at remembering to use them. It‚Äôs a really hard disease to deal with, everyone is different but I just wanted to suggest to try and get her moving as soon as she is able it really does help.

They all wished they had quit smoking sooner. Your mom will be prescribed several medications to reduce the inflammation in her lungs. Imagine breathing through a straw. That is what it feels like during an exacerbation and sometimes after. In order for her to get better, she must continue her meds (I'm on a few, it's OK) and stay on oxygen so her saturation levels don't fall below 88%. For those without lung disease, anything over 90% is OK. Pulse oximeters measure oxygen sats and heart rate. These can be bought over the counter in Walmart, Walgreens, Amazon etc. She may need to use a nebulizer. This is a small compressor that turns liquid medicine to a mist. Your mom was probably doing these breathing treatments in the hospital. My patients do this several times a day. As long as she makes some changes, she can live for quite awhile. I have patients in their late 80's.\n\nLastly, the hospital may have a pulmonary rehab program.

hyw2xea,t3x6ds,It sounds like you have emphysema (as the scan report). Emphysema doesn't necessarily mean COPD. COPD is proven by spirometry but it may falsely look like COPD if you have pneumonia or an organising pneumonia. \n\nThe bigger issue is the organising pneumonia. Forgtmet about the COPD aspect for now.\n\nYou need to talk to your doctor about the organising pneumonia as they're rare and can be caused by things other than infectious bacteria/viruses.\n\nThis CT report is way beyond the scope of this sub.

I'm not saying you have asthma or not, I'm just saying don't rule it out.\n\nYou definitely do not have COPD as it often has distinctive characteristics such as on the chest x-ray and spirometry, plus a chronic history of smoking and possibly A1AT deficiency (if you don't smoke)",1646066829,t3_t3hfzd,/r/COPD/comments/t3hfzd/please_i_need_an_opinion_for_my_situation/hysoj5t/

hysk23h,t3hfzd,What happens in Upper airway cough syndrome is that there is a vicious cycle of chronic forceful coughing that continues to irritate your airways and cause chronic mucus production and make you feel like you need to cough. It's probably worth trying to break the cycle. Chat to your doctor about therapies.\n\nThe mucus might not particularly be there and your body is just interpreting irritated airways as feeling like something is present. \n\nSmall volumes of mucus don't show up on xray and can sometimes show up on spirometry in your fef25-75/mef etc.,1646065085,t1_hys9ze9,/r/COPD/comments/t3hfzd/please_i_need_an_opinion_for_my_situation/hysk23h/

hyqxje4,t33bdj,I agree with what others have said here. I agree that it's likely cor pulmonary which might be exacerbated by minor infections.\n\nThe main treatment is getting the oxygen right and some diuretics for the swelling. \n\nThe unfortunate thing sometimes about patient's rights and the right to your bodily autonomy is that it means you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink. I'm sure the doctors would love to help you and treat your mam but writing letters to the practice unfortunately cannot change anything. The most they can do is call her and try to talk it out over the phone and that phone call should be initiated by your mam.\n\nI think you need to be firm with your mam rather than the doctor. Maybe try to negotiate smaller things first like suggesting that the treatment might just be a review and a water tablet or a review and an adjustment to her oxygen. She likely won't try BPAP as it's quite extreme compared to the other 2 options. \n\nPersonally I'd be worried that she's simply incredibly anxious or possibly depressed (or both regarding her own mortality or her husband passing away) and might be allowing herself to die passively. At some point you're going to have to have that conversation with her.

It sounds like you don't have COPD based on what you've said.\n\nIf you're still short of breathe then you can do further respiratory tests such as lung volumes to see if you have restricted breathing or lung diffusion to see if your lungs find it hard to take up oxygen.\n\nIf these are normal then you should probably look into doing a CPET. This will tell you if you breathlessness is caused primarily by your lungs, heart or being unfit.\n\nYou should consider alternative rarer causes of breathlessness in your age group such as angina or acid reflux. Occasionally people on here have said your blood sugar being high can cause breathlessness. Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency can cause over reactive airways which you might be experiencing as breathlessness. \n\nI would probably have these checked out prior to putting it down to anxiety.

hy9b0qk,t0cwls,"This is a very comprehensive post and thank you for the level of detail.\n\nWhile we are not your doctor and cannot replace the opinion of your doctor, there are a few things that stood out to me.\n\nFirstly, your CT scan. You clearly had tuberculosis in the past, whether you knew it or not. Did they test you to see if it was latent TB (Quantiferon test) or see if it needed to be eradicated? There is a small chance that TB can reactivate during illnesses that affect your immune system like COVID.\n\nNext is the spirometry. It's so comprehensive. Normal spirometry doesn't outrule asthma either, just makes it less likely. The way I think about it is if your airways are not inflamed and not clamping down due to uncontrolled asthma then the bronchodilators aren't going to change the airways. Spirometry will be normal in people with controlled asthma.\n\nUnfortunately I can't read variable extra-thoracic obstruction from the spirometry. Maybe FIF %pred is missing? You also generally need to see the flow-volume loop to diagnose it. Why do you have extra-thoracic obstruction? Laryngitis, big tonsils, something else blocking your airway when you breathe in?\n\nRegarding the second CT, the radiologist was probably right and it was likely a resolving COVID infiltrate or band of atelectasis rather than a scar surely? The fact you needed oxygen does make COVID-related scarring slightly more likely, however.\n\nFinally, on to Breztri. This is one of many new triple inhaled therapy medications and they are not necessarily for COPD, rather that is what the manufacturer got the licence to treat for that inhaler. It may be the case that they will obtain the licence to use it in asthma in the near future once they are granted a licence for it.\n\nOne thing is for certain either way - triple therapy is way overkill for what you are describing. If you look at the GOLD (COPD) guidelines or the GINA (Asthma) guidelines then both would recommend starting with a single LABA or LAMA like formoterol or tiotropium in the case of COPD or using a combo LABA/ICS for asthma such as symbicort or the likes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you still may have asthma, cough-variant asthma or post-viral bronchitis which might be treated with the inhaled steroid and I would hope this is what your doctor is thinking. It just seems a little like overkill so maybe ask if they thought it would be reasonable to go on to something like as needed symbicort or something. Get checked for TB.\n\nHope this is useful.",1645720015,t3_t0cwls,/r/COPD/comments/t0cwls/looking_for_advice/hy9b0qk/
hy9jufo,t0cwls,"This was a very thoughtful response - I am truly grateful.\n\nIn response -\n\n1. I have not been tested for TB - I also have never known myself to have TB, so this is a very interesting take and I will get checked for this.\n2. There was no guidance on the obstruction found.  In fact, he was somewhat dismissive of his findings on the PFT when I pushed for us to review this in-person.   His words ""I review thousands of these and nothing here concerns me""\n   1. I did raise my concern that the nodule in my left lung has increased remarkably over the past 2-3 years.   However he seems to be uninterested in pursuing it further.  That he would ""need to see proof that it has grown substantially"" to have any concern about it.\n   2. When it was initially found in 2019,  I was in the hospital with severe sinusitis, and through a comprehensive exam and imaging they made me aware of a ""calcified granuloma that is only a couple of mm's in size - barely the size of the tip of a pinky nail"" and assured me that it was nothing to worry about.\n   3. I should point out that I also had testicular cancer and surgery for removal in August of 2021 - I'm comfortable admitting I get a bit anxious now about lumps, bumps, nodules or other irregularities.\n3.

hybernz,t0cwls,"> You clearly had tuberculosis in the past\n\nIt doesn't need to be TB, it could be any infection.\n\nAlso, given OP's PFT, they don't have asthma.

hyahsdq,t0cwls,"1. That's interesting. It's very likely old TB but there may still be TB in that Ghon focus/complex. If I were a doctor, I would have been more concerned about that. Anyone in your family unwell with ""chronic pneumonia"" or something like that from your childhood or did you need to spend time in a hospital for 3-6 months as a child?\n2. Okay, **now I see where the misunderstanding has occurred**. I'm sorry that I didn't pick up that you meant obstruction in this definition of the word. It's just as well you came to this sub though haha.   \nSo COPD is intrathoracic obstruction which means the obstructions occurs when you breathe out only. Extrathoracic obstruction is when you experience breathing difficulty when breathing in. COPD is when your can breathe in easily but you have to breathe through a straw when breathing out. What you have is almost the opposite. When you breathe in, it is similar to breathing in through a straw and when you breathe out, it is normal.  \nYou don't have COPD. You have extrathoracic obstruction. The investigation of this condition is very very different. It is probable that your physician is completely right and there is no real extrathoracic obstruction. the only real way to know is if you look at the upper airway with pharyngolaryngoscoscopy / bronchoscopy. Extrathoracic obstruction occurs above the level of the vocal cords so an ENT referral might be enough to diagnose the problem if a problem even exists.\n   1. Regarding the growth of solitary nodules, doctors generally use the Fleischner guidelines. Your nodule is calcified which, as a rule makes it very likely to be old inactive TB and therefore mostly unconcerning (about 1 in 3 people worldwide have TB and a subset of these have a Ghon focus... this is more unusual if you are in the US versus India for example)\n   2. They may have been underplaying it's size because I'd imaigne most people get freaked out about lung nodules. 2mm is much smaller than an 8-10mm pinkie nail.\n   3. That's a fair enough concern and, obviously it's important. The calcified Ghon focus and lymph nodes are completely unrelated to it but you should always be suspicious of new solid lung nodules. Testicular cancer is no joke if you don't detect it early.\n3. A beautiful flow-volume loop haha, but yeah it does show extra-thoracic obstruction which may be normal for you depending on how tight your upper airway is. Worth an ENT visit, even privately to get a pharyngolaryngoscopy.\n\nAgain, I hope this is helpful.",1645736026,t1_hy9jufo,/r/COPD/comments/t0cwls/looking_for_advice/hyahsdq/
hycwr1w,t0cwls,"No, it actually couldn't be any infection. It's really just TB, histoplasmosis (granulomatous diseases) and some cancers that give that appearance of the Ghon/Ranke complex. TB would be the most common cause worldwide, which is why I said TB. This has been a well described phenomenon for nearly 100 years. \n\nNormal PFTs don't necessarily exclude asthma and I'm not sure where you heard otherwise. If you still suspect asthma and have normal spirometry then you should probably go on to do provocation testing with inhaled histamine or methacholine.",1645778054,t1_hybernz,/r/COPD/comments/t0cwls/looking_for_advice/hycwr1w/

I went through some papers and tadalafil didn't show any SpO2 loss (unlike sildenaifil). I am not sure if even tadalafil is good in COPD but based on my limited understanding it seems to be better than sildenafil.\n\n>How much of the low oxygen do you think is just down to his lungs recovering from the most recent infection?\n\nHe has been on overnight oxygen therapy for last 4-5 years. His daytime resting SpO2 used to be 86-90 and in november 2021, doctor started sildenafil 20mg three times a day. And post that his resting SpO2 dropped to like 82-86. He was admitted in Nov 2021 for an infection and he was admitted again in Feb 2022 for a non-infection related COPD episode (hypercapnia) and sildenafil was stopped during this admission lasting around 10 days. And his resting oxygen was around 88-94 this time around after discharge. Although, discharge meds included continuation of sildenafil and soon after like 3-4 days of discharge, his resting SpO2 gradually dropped back to 82-86. This gives me a rough idea that sildenafil is the culprit here.

hx509vx,stmdbl,"I used to smoke a lot and drink a fair amount. It's been 9 years without smoking and I only drink periodically. I mention this because I attributed EXACTLY what you experience in your first paragraph to those habits. However, I later found out I had GERD and the smoking/drinking would really amplify that symptom. \n\nThe reflux was amplified by drinking along with eating spicy or acidic foods or overeating. The stomach acid refluxing into the back of my throat would cause irritation that caused my body to generate a lot of mucus, often leading me to feel like I was choking on it until I ""hacked"" or coughed it up and spit it or swallowed it. Smoking would irritate my throat and make it worse. \n\nEven after quitting smoking, I still have this problem to varying degrees and my ""clearing"" my throat is a source of irritation for my wife although she understands. I try to muffle it in public, but the sensation is annoying.\n\nGERD often is associated with asthma as well. I suspect it has to do something with the bodies response to the acid in the throat and possibilities of small amounts being aspirated into the lungs, especially when horizontal. I have asthma (not like asthma attacks) that sometimes creates a tightness in my chest from allergies and it's also exercise induced. It just gets a bit harder to breathe and when I jog I sound like I'm dying, but I am okay, other than being winded and having a higher heart rate. My Ventolin inhaler works well to allow me to breathe easier while overexerting.\n\nI was diagnosed with COPD ""unofficially"" and not sent to a pulmonologist because my asthma/allergy doc and meds have it under control. I was at 50% lung function or less during some tests, but was up to above 90 or even 95 last time. I suspect a complicated mix of GERD, gastritis, gastroparesis, allergies, asthma and pneumonia are responsible for a misdiagnosis.\n\nSo with all that, I am not a doctor, but I suspect if your PFT was fine, you are experiencing similarities to what I am. GERD and possible asthma. Laying down with GERD after eating will worsen symptoms, thus I tend to wake up worse and get better throughout the day. I'd suggest speaking to your doctor and tracking your intake vs reactions when you drink alcohol or consume acidic or spicy food.

I believe all of these are interconnected and I'm trying to get some coordinated treatment by switching to an internist from a PA and following up with a gastroenterologist.\n\nI believe I micro-aspirate, especially when sleeping. Depending on what I eat and my gastric status, this exacerbates my asthma and COPD. \n\nOften when I wake up, I cough up small globs of thick mucus. Usually it's clear and not indicative of an infection. I use Trelegy Ellipta in the morning and sometimes cough up a little bit more and tend to be clear the rest of the day. \n\nWhen I choose spicy or acidic food or even drink my coffee, I sometimes feel like I am creating some issues with my asthma. Everything seems so interconnected, that I do actually think my COPD might have been misdiagnosed after getting bad pneumonia. \n\nMometasone Furoate has been amazing for taming my sinus reactions and I recently started an antihistamine pill daily. My bad breathing days have been much reduced. I think part of my issues have been histamine reactions in overdrive creating mucus in my throat and lungs both from reflux and allergies. My thoughts are that this has been causing asthma problems. Combined with my smoking history, past pneumonia, and occasional bronchitis, I think it resembles COPD.\n\nI am hoping with a new primary (Internist), I can somehow get everything coordinated instead of being dismissed by some of my providers that are not looking at the big picture.",1644960587,t3_stcyqu,/r/COPD/comments/stcyqu/copd_and_gerdlpr/hx379wn/

hvtcpkt,sly0vt,Definitely make that appointment with the pulmonary doctor.  Your story is pretty similar to mine and I ended up having copd.

hvxz3ch,sly0vt,The good news is that those results are VERY close to normal! You may just need to start a daily inhaler to control inflammation.

hw1eopo,sly0vt,"Typically, the first session with a pulmonologist consists only of a physical examination and if required, recommendations for further tests or treatments. You mentioned that your chest x-rays last month were clear so it‚Äôs highly unlikely that you would need to do them again. The ‚Äúmild obstructive pattern‚Äù on your lung function test means that it‚Äôs slightly harder for you to breathe ‚Äì this poses more of a problem when your rate of breathing increases since it means that there is less time for you to exhale the air out of your lungs before the next inhalation. This is a pretty common occurrence with smokers who tend to experience mild to moderate airflow obstruction. The ‚Äúno significant bronchodilator response‚Äù on the test is a good thing since greater bronchodilator response can correlate with worse asthma control. The presence of a bronchodilator response can help distinguish asthma from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) but some COPD patients can also have a bronchodilator response. The normal value for an FEV1/FVC ratio is above 0.75-85 which means that your result of 0.69 is suggestive of airflow limitation with an obstructive pattern. Normally, FEV1 is between 70% and 80% in normal adults, and any value less than 70% indicates the possibility of COPD so your 90% result is in the clear. You also mentioned emphysema which is possible but less likely since most people with tobacco-related emphysema begin to experience symptoms after the age of 40. You mentioned that you have had asthma since you were a child and you smoked after that, so it‚Äôs likely that your shortness of breath and wheezing is linked to these issues and does not have a more serious underlying cause. In addition to not smoking, you can [check out this article](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/copd-pictures/simple-habits-to-help-you-breathe-better/) for ways to improve your breathing.   \n  \nDiscuss your treatment options in detail with the pulmonologist, especially since you mentioned that your albuterol inhaler is no longer effective. Since all asthma is not the same, most asthma meds are not equally effective for everyone but albuterol is the exception. That is because of the method in which albuterol works to manage asthma symptoms. Certain kinds of white blood cells called eosinophils cause airway inflammation and many asthma medications, including corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation. However, researchers recently found that a little under 50% of people with asthma do not have these eosinophils which is why corticiosteroid medications did not work for them. However, albuterol doesn‚Äôt reduce inflammation but instead works by relaxing the muscles around the airways to ease breathing. In fact, the researchers concluded that albuterol is as effective for those with eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma ‚Äì you can check the study [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22268133/). Another possibility is that you are using your inhaler more than you need to ‚Äì this overuse is linked to chest tightness, wheezing, and night-time awakening. Keep a track of how often you use your inhaler and then discuss this with your doc. Hope this helps",1644292501,t3_sly0vt,/r/COPD/comments/sly0vt/can_this_be_copd_or_emphysema/hw1eopo/

It isnt easy to quit I know but neither is not being able to breathe. \n\nonce he has the testing done, they will most likely prescribe a daily medication by way of an inhaler & they may determine a rescue inhaler would help (they determine this during the spirometry test to see if his FEV1 improves after using ventolin)\n\nHe may need supplemental oxygen but that too will be determined during testing. they often combine the spirometry test with what is called a walk test. this test just has you walk for 6 minutes & they monitor your oxygen sat during it plus how far you can walk for that time. \n\nIt does sound from what you describe your Dad is moderate to severe stage but the evaluation will determine that for sure. \n\nquitting smoking, inhalers, daily exercise will all help his condition, but it cannot be reversed, but can be slowed by living a healthier lifestyle. he may benefit from pulmonary rehab, which involves nutrition advise, assistance with quitting smoking & exercise as well as breathing techniques. \nhope that helps a little.",1643650071,t3_sh5xtu,/r/COPD/comments/sh5xtu/dad_just_been_diagnosed_with_emphysema/hv0n2za/

Stopping smoking at your age puts you back at the same risk as everyone else. \n\nLook up the Fletcher-Peto curve to know what I mean. \n\nAt your age, asthma or smoking-related actue bronchitis is the most likely cause of your shortness of breath.",1642678383,t3_s8gjx9,/r/COPD/comments/s8gjx9/deleted_by_user/htg32yw/

I have GOLD IV, very severe emphysema, and after 15 months of self isolating, shunning all human contact and living in fear, last May I was finally eligible to get my first jab (Holland has been consistently late with vaccines, only got my booster on Jan 2nd).\n\nAnyway, in the week after I got my shot, I felt kinda ill. Bit of a fever, increased shortness of breath, elevated heart rate. At the time I put it down to an exaggerated immune response to the vaccine, but some time later I got the results of a blood test which showed antibodies against the virus¬π, so apparently that was my bout with covid. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n\nIt's been a great relief knowing that, _for me_, it wasn't such a big deal, so I just go to the stores even with Omicron spiking at the moment. Without a mask, I have a medical exemption because CO2 retention. That said, there are a lot of people who don't wear masks, I doubt they all have a medical exemption. The ones who wear masks more often than not are dicknosing. We are _so_ [redacted]. \n\nOver here lockdown has been lifted in spite of record numbers which are a gross undercount because the advice is to no longer get a PCR to confirm a rapid ag home test (aka a lateral flow test). The test positivity rate is currently 40% and rising, so yeah.. they're missing a _lot_ of cases.\n\nIt seems the thinking is that by now everyone who wanted to get a booster has had the opportunity to get one and the rest can sink or swim, which imho is fair. What with the high infectiousness it looks like just about anyone who isn't taking extreme measures is going to get it anyway. Thankfully most people will have no or only minimal symptoms. I'm just happy that my Tai Chi lessons will resume and that I can again have a coffee at my favourite table just down the street.\n\nFwiw, I'm relatively young with no co-morbidities and apart from the poopy lungs, I'm pretty healthy. Using diet and lifestyle I also try and keep inflammation low and my immune system in check (a lot of the damage from covid (and COPD) is because immune overreaction).\n\nYour mileage may obviously substantially vary. Just thought I'd respond to let you know that catching COVID as a COPD patient does not necessarily have to be an emergency. Obviously an ounce of prevention etc, better safe than sorry and all that\n\n It looks like this particular wave will peak rapidly (maybe it is already past its peak where you're at?), though there might be a long 'tail' and we'll have to wait for spring to come until we'll all be able to breathe more freely. <ba-dumm tiss>\n\nGood luck!\n\n¬π after getting vaccinated you only make antibodies against the spike protein.

hsr0jzm,s4frcm,"Some background: I used to be very short of breath, needed a mobility scooter to get around because I couldn't walk for more than 20 meters (70 ft) before pausing a minute or two to catch my breath, a stairlift to get upstairs, had to shower seated.. the works. \n\nThen a couple of years ago I learned that what you eat has quite an effect on how much CO2 is produced by the body. Burning carbs produces almost 1¬Ω times as much CO2 per unit of O2 than burning fats. To compound this problem, the muscles of folks with COPD change from slow twitch to the rapid twitch type which use more carbs.\n\nSo, I switched to a ketogenic diet eating lots of fat and next to no carbs. The effect was remarkable, I could suddenly walk farther and exercise tolerance in general was much improved. So much so that I eventually felt confident enough to return the mobility scooter I had on loan from social services (I've kept the stairlift, but now it's mostly a laundry basket and litter box lift üòÉ)\n\nI posted about my experience a while ago in this sub, because I felt maybe more people could benefit from what I did.\n\n\n>Do you feel different if you're wearing a mask?\n\nWearing a mask forces you to breathe in part of your (CO2 laden) outbreath, which makes me hecking short of breath. I don't have the mobility scooter anymore and I can't walk being this short of breath. I'm already huffing and puffing like a steam engine whenever I exert myself (and yes, a leisurely walk is quite the exertion) and wearing a mask pushes me into ""if I don't sit down I'm gonna pass out"" territory which is obviously less than ideal\n\n\n\n>Have you had any severe situations with co2 retention?\n\nYeah, before I switched diets I used to be in and out of hospital, often needing non-invasive ventilation (BPAP) in the ICU, at times slipping into a coma from respiratory failure. Luckily for me, my current diet is very anti inflammatory which has (so far) prevented exacerbations and I have only been in hospital once these past four years and that was to get a new hip.

hsqd991,s4d158,I have had COPD for 20 years and in my opinion it sounds like you have the beginning stages. But only the doctors will be able to clarify that. I do have a breathing technique that will help you tremendously. Also if you stress out get anxious that will make your breathing worse so you need to be able to calm yourself down.\n\nNow do this breathing technique and you will feel better I promise. With your mouth closed take a deep breath as long as you can and through pursed lips exhale (kinda like blowing up a balloon) about 8 seconds and continue to do this until you feel better.\n\nThis help get the CO2 that is trapped in your lungs out.

hslv6ro,s3evok,Not necessarily. \n\nMosaic attenuation just means that areas of your lung appear darker (more full of air because of air being trapped by obstructed airways from any cause) in some parts and brighter in others (either due to normal lung being present or an infection being present)\n\nCauses can include inflammatory bronchiolitis or viral infections. Some other causes relate to issues with the blood vessels in the lungs becoming leaky or blocked but this is rare.\n\nI would suspect that you did PFTs too soon after the event and should get them repeated in mid-late February. Bronchiolitis will show up on PFTs as a reduction in the FEF/MEF portion of the test. Ask your doctor about this and if you need a further CT scan to ensure the resolution of the mosaic pattern.\n\nThere's a good radiopaedia article on mosaic CT patterns.,1642150688,t3_s3evok,/r/COPD/comments/s3evok/confused/hslv6ro/

How is it reversible?\n\nI (43M) think I may have chronic bronchitis - since almost 5 years ago I had yearly or biannual episodes of chest infection that would last for several months (usually 3-6 months). Always starts with a cold that comes down into my chest. Although at one point I felt completely OK for about year and a half, I thought I was cured, but it came back 2 years ago. I've seen different pulmonologists, but still didn't get clear diagnosis except for ""reactive airways syndrome"" non-diagnosis. My spiro tests is always very good (last one was 110% for my age/weight) and oxygenation usually at 97%. Multiple CTs and X-rays didn't show anything. I used to cough a lot initially, but recently I just clear my chest on purpose. I do currently spit out multiple eggcup volumes per day, right now the color is green/yellow. Also a feeling of malaise and frequent headaches. Currently on antibiotics and prednisolone, as well as Symbicort and Spiriva inhalers.\nI suspect I may have some sort of chronic bronchitis due to inhalation injury - I used to smoke cigarettes for about 15 years, and also cannabis for longer than that and I think I may have hurt my lungs by smoking cannabis from dirty pipe when I inhaled too much soot (my lungs felt very weird - crackling and wheezing - after one smoking session and my problems started with a lung infection a few weeks after that). My current pulmonologist says I may be right, but he said we need to exclude other causes as the chronic bronchitis will be diagnosed by exclusion. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",1641944201,t3_s1pp26,/r/COPD/comments/s1pp26/copd_what_it_is_and_is_not_a_sufferers_quick_guide/hs9zyux/

hsc6ghz,s1pp26,"You're right, I meant chronic bronchitis (though acute is somewhat reversible too). I'll amend this and add in a bronchitis section.\n\nChronic bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis (defined by the presence of a cough for at least 3 months per year for at least 2 consecutive years). It's just a description that doctors give to anything that can cause that symptom and chronic bronchitis may not be confirmable by testing. At a cellular level, chronic bronchitis is characterised by airway wall inflammation and an increase in the number of cells in the airways that create and secrete mucus (goblet cells).\n\nChronic bronchitis is somewhat reversible with corticosteroids (inhaled, nebulised or oral) as this tends to reduce airway wall inflammation and reduces the number of goblet cells that produce mucus.\n\nFor acute bronchitis, the vast majority is caused by viruses and is self limiting and is gone within a few days (i.e. a chest infection). Other infections such as pertussis are characterised by the ""100 day cough"". Acute bronchitis (even if viral) can develop into chronic bronchitis and up to 1 in 3 may have a cough for up to 3 years, especially if you have factors that continue to drive inflammation such as persistent coughing, personal smoke exposure or environmental smoke exposure.\n\nRegarding your situation, you may have an short-lived infection (\~1 week) that your body clears successfully but it end up triggering a prolonged bout of bronchitis as a result. It may be impossible to distinguish the symptoms of bronchitis caused by ongoing inflammation as a result of a recent infection versus bronchitis caused by an active infection.\n\nChronic bronchitis may not appear at all on spirometry but does predispose you to developing COPD later in live due to chronic airway remodeling in the setting of chronic inflammation.\n\nYour CT scan being normal has mostly excluded bronchiectasis thankfully and almost makes the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis certain even in the presence of the volume of mucus you produce.\n\nA final attempt might be that you need a bronchoscopy for an airway inspection and/or and airway biopsy as there are rarer conditions such as eosinophilic bronchitis that can drive the process that might only show up on airway biopsy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some reading:\n\n[Chronic mucus and COPD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26695373/)\n\n[Eosinophilic Bronchitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087164/)\n\n[Goblet cells and chronic cough](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10712357/)",1641988582,t1_hs9zyux,/r/COPD/comments/s1pp26/copd_what_it_is_and_is_not_a_sufferers_quick_guide/hsc6ghz/

i1mq20d,s1pp26,"Ah see I do have copd and it's severe. I was having an argument or shall we say a heated discussion with someone else in another forum and I've commented quite a few times on here on other posts that the lung function can't be used alone all the time (and I've been shot down for it) for diagnosing the type or Stage of your copd . I hate those Stage brackets that some doctors put patients in because it adds extra stress and anxiety to the patients and thankfully my doctors in London don't use them either. I have severe copd, (emphysema), pulmonary hypertension but I also have something called neurofibromatosis related lung disease which causes fibromas and cysts in the lungs, a very rare and (unfortunately for me) complicated disease. When I was diagnosed in April last year I was in hospital for another reason, supposed to be sent home the following day but ended up staying in for 2 weeks, chest x-ray's, ct scan lung function in that order, endless amounts of ABG's to get my oxygen prescription right. Sent home early May on 3 litres of oxygen 24/7, returned to the chest clinic in June, another lung function (1st lung function I was classed as 78% 2nd one I was classed as 73% which puts me in the Mild Stage) which are the results above and my oxygen was turned up to 4 litres. I returned in October to the chest clinic and only 3x ABG's were done this time one on arrival whee I was very breathless had my oxygen turned up to 7 litres, 2nd ABG then turned up to 8 litres and even after a 3rd ABG  my Po2 number and O2% numbers were not high enough but they decided to send me home to see if my body needed time to adjust to the high amounts of oxygen. My local respiratory team of nurses in Guildford came out to see me and did a CBG 2 weeks later and my numbers had come up so I stayed on 8 litres.  2 weeks ago after struggling for a  few weeks with being breathless my local respiratory nurses came out again to see me and again my Po2 was low as was my O2% I had my oxygen turned up again to 9 litres and after 30 minutes and another CBG they were still slightly low but now my PCo2 was slightly high but they decided to wait to see if my body needed to adjust and they are due back in the next few days to see me. They come out to see me because I've been living with Chronic Pain since October 2019 because of a tumour in my leg which is ongoing and I'm waiting for a 3rd operation to hopefully remove it, walk with a frame at home, carers coming in so I've really been through it in the last 2+ years.",1647929696,t1_i1kmhjp,/r/COPD/comments/s1pp26/copd_what_it_is_and_is_not_a_sufferers_quick_guide/i1mq20d/

As it stands this is not currently a medical device ( we are currently going through the regulation pathway), we also do not intend this to replace your doctor. This is an addition that can help you better understand what effects your condition, how your medication impacts you, monitor your health (lung function, symptoms) and helps you to make positive behavioral changes (example, adhere to your medication plan better. 50% of prescribed medication is not taken as directed). In turn you are a more knowledgeable patient and can avoid triggers, know what symptoms you really suffer from, what can help alleviate them and can have knowledgeable conversations with your doctor leading to a better controlled condition. \n2. We have no intention to sell the data. \n3. That will all fall under the medical regulation category we sit in, we are currently working with a consultant and the FDA on this. Also, all data collected will be anonymised. \n\nThank you very much for your feedback, if you leave your email on the site we will be in touch with updates in anycase!",1641933338,t1_hs901p2,/r/COPD/comments/s1ilbj/my_project_app_for_helping_people_better_manage/hs97bq3/
hs6ls4m,s1653s,Alpha1 patient here. I'd recommend posting to the asthma subreddit as this is far far more likely than having COPD. You don't smoke and your symptoms are intermittent and more typical of asthma. Keep a peak flow diary (3 peak flows in morning and evening (8am/8pm) and write down the best of 3 results).\nThe alternative is that this is post nasal drip which is very common and typically has mucus and throat clearing.\nGERD is less likely to cause these symptoms.,1641888783,t3_s1653s,/r/COPD/comments/s1653s/what_is_wheezing_in_copd/hs6ls4m/

hs9rlbe,s1653s,I meant to answer your question also. A wheeze is a musical sound that generally originates in your lower airways due to the smaller tubes in your airways (bronchioles) becoming narrowed from mucus/inflammation/bronchitis etc. The narrowing of the airway causes a high-pitched whistling/musical noise. I always think about it in the way that you make a tiny narrow hole with your tongue and hard palate when you want to whistle with your mouth. The same concept happens in the smaller airways but there are thousands of narrow wholes whistling together haha,1641940832,t1_hs921il,/r/COPD/comments/s1653s/what_is_wheezing_in_copd/hs9rlbe/

Looking through your posts, you are well versed in what bronchitis is.\n\n1) Frothy mucus as you're describing coming passively up into you're mouth is not typical.\n\n2) Ask for spirometry given your cannabis history.

An ogd to look for a hiatus hernia wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n3) No, this isn't typical of COPD and you relative low smoking history almost excludes COPD. You are far far far more likely to have asthma as the cause of bronchitis/obstructive pulmonary disease at your age.\n\n4) Not a doc. A smoker's cough can have a mucoid appearance but what you describe is throat clearing and froth coming up passively while eating.

Get lots of natural ways to get vitamins. I buy a bottle of %100 orange juice every week and dilute it with water and that is all I ever drink. I also do the intermittent fasting diet and exercise.\n\nGet you vitamins from food, don't buy them they aren't regulated by the FDA and you could be getting nothing but rice pills. This was the advise of two infectious disease physicians, not my opinion.\n\nOther than doing those basic things and the suggested precautions there isn't anything really extra you can do other than strengthen yourself. Like a solider, just get ready for combat. Also mentally, don't frighten yourself with this. Stay sober minded about things and enjoy each day. Take a holistic approach in that you strengthen your mind and body both.  Get a good mask or at least double mask, stay away from large crowds and dont think that just because you miss your buddies wedding or huge party you are missing out on living. This isnt going to be the terror it is now forever.

hq6zxfv,rp6v1l,"43 M here, I have had issues with chest congestion, chronic productive cough and recurring bronchitis that would linger for months. I believe it was related to smoking/vaping marijuana. This was 4.5 years ago, at age 38, now 43. After one smoking session I felt some irritation in the lungs. A few weeks after I caught a cold that developed into bronchitis, this bronchitis lingered for many months. This happens regularly now and I end up with chest congestion and  productive cough for most of the year. Like you, PFT, lung CTs, X-rays, oxygenation, everything looks good. Saw multiple pulmonary specialists and didn't get many answers. The only diagnosis I ever got was Reactive Airway Disease which as I understand is kind of non-diagnosis. This last time I had it, I got a treatment of Prednisone and Symbicort and perhaps this time it seemed to help a little bit and decreased the coughing/congestion. Previously I didn't really feel like inhalers helped me much at all. I stopped smoking/vaping anything soon after the first episode in 2017. I also used to be a cigarette smoker for over 10 years, but stopped in early 30s.\n\nLet me know how your issue develops, seem like you may have similar issue.\n\nAlso you have mentioned that you feel congested after eating, you should probably look into Laryngopharyngeal reflux.

hjvgsnd,qpi9zk,"This is a hill I am going to die on.  I'm an adult critical care specialty certified respiratory therapist for reference. Most breathing issues that have symptoms, aka dyspnea, shortness of breath, etc have nothing to do with your oxygen levels. Truly symptomatic hypoxia looks completely opposite of those suffering COPD/Asthma/CHF exacerbations. Often the low oxygen people feel euphoric, but mostly just confused and sleepy. We're getting to actually see true hypoxic pts thanks to covid, you've seen them in the news called happy hypoxics. You can absolutely have COPD and be suffering a terrible exacerbation and be totally fine oxygen wise. It is common to see lower oxygen levels with exacerbations simply because of the nature of the disease and the physics of gases but they are not automatically tied together. \n\nI tell my COPD patients to stop checking their home pulse oximeter and instead listen to their own bodies. Are they struggling more than they were yesterday? Did putting on pants get more difficult this week? Etc.

One benefit of Spiriva is you only need to take it once a day, some inhalers like Atrovent have to been taken four times a day!",1634970184,t3_qdetxc,/r/COPD/comments/qdetxc/medication/hhprvk3/

He would feel better so he'd take up smoking again and go down hill quickly and quit smoking again and did that over and over.\n\nIf he made it that long I have a shot since I have zero desire to smoke and already eat very healthy and exercise because unfortunately in the middle of all this I've become Type 2 Diabetic.

hhmrmje,qdetxc,The cancer has been nothing more than a big hassle. I got a rare cancer that doesn‚Äôt metastasize and never kills anyone. When they can biopsy for type without removing it - they‚Äôll just leave it and watch it. My body hated the surgery though. Now surgeries - plural. Long boring story and a massive hassle. But the upside is that I was finally diagnosed (and no longer misdiagnosed!) and now that I‚Äôm on the right meds - including Spiriva- I feel a whole lot better.,1634917145,t1_hhmp3ta,/r/COPD/comments/qdetxc/medication/hhmrmje/

hhzksih,qdetxc,"I am really surprised that they told you that you were in the severe category.\n\nIf you can run 2 miles a day, I really doubt that you are in the severe category.  As stated above, my brother is on oxygene 24/7, can hardly walk from his bedroom to the bathroon and is lung capicity is around 10%.  That is considered severe (or very severe in it's case) according to the COPD founddation and GOLD standard.\n\nTo give you an idea about spirometry, the numbers and the GOLD standard COPD stages:\n\n[https://www.copdfoundation.org/Learn-More/I-am-New-to-COPD/Stages-of-COPD.aspx](https://www.copdfoundation.org/Learn-More/I-am-New-to-COPD/Stages-of-COPD.aspx)\n\nFEV1 is one of the most important number to determine lung capicity for COPD.  If your FEV1 number is at 50% of the predicted normal value (which take into consideration, your age, sex, height, etc.), you would fall into the moderate stage according to the COPD Gold standard.  That number is not everything but it gives you a good idea of your lung capacity and the progression of the desease over time as well as to determine if the medication helps.  For instance, my lung capacity is at 55% (FEV1 1.75, predicted 3.20) but I can't run at all without quickly running out of breath. \n\nWhen they say that your lung capacity is at 50%, I assume that your FEV1 was at 50% of the predited normal value.\n\nI have a spirometry at home which I use from times to times.  I compared it with the spirometry tests done at the hospital and numbers were quite on par.  I usually am between 50-55%.  On bad days or if I do not take my medication, I can fall between 40-50%.  On good days and just after I take a puff or 2 of my ventolin inhaler, I can reach 60%.  So that number tends to varry but usually not that much when you take your midecine regularly (unless you catch a cold or something.  But I would not test myself in those occasions).\n\nAnyway, I am just very surprised that they told you that you were in the severe (even worst) category as it doesn't look that way based on what you can do or your lung capacity at the time of your test.\n\nBest of luck to you and take care.",1635171557,t1_hhrqlbj,/r/COPD/comments/qdetxc/medication/hhzksih/

hhzmsri,qdetxc,"Reading you all talk about the stages is why I asked them.  Otherwise I don't think she would have told me.  When I first found out the MA just called me and said ""You have COPD and some Emphysema.""\n\nI immediately googled it and the first thing that came up was life expectancy of 5 years, to which I about freaked out.  I sent the doc a message from our hospital App asking if there was anything I could do to extend my life expectancy.  He called me right away and apologized for the MA telling me that over the phone.  They were supposed to make an appointment.\n\nIt's funny because when I just saw them last week (he has a PA that works with him and I saw both of them) he said the one thing he wishes he could do was take that down the google page about life expectancy because it scares so many people.\n\nI don't smoke anymore and am very active, but maybe I can do all this because I've been doing it for a long time?  Doc said I'm doing everything right and should live a long time if I don't go back to bad habits like smoking.\n\nHe told me you wouldn't believe the amount of people that don't quit when they find out, and that might be part of the problem of the low life expectancy.  He also said people are usually diagnosed a lot older than me (I'm 50) but that doesn't mean they didn't have it back when they were 50, they just didn't go to the doc.\n\nAnyway, that's what they told me.

hhnd6qu,qdetxc,"Lol yeah.. those people who only get diagnosed in their 70s and who don't stop smoking are really dragging the average survival rate down.\n\nAlso, you can't get diagnosed unless you go see a doctor.

hhq7376,qdetxc,"Well that was me, limping into the hospital gasping for breath and I am fortunate to be union so I have excellent insurance.  My gasping was from my anemia - I didn't have enough platelets to move oxygen around my body.  I was taking huge deep breaths and blowing them out properly and still felt like I wasn't getting any air.  It was terrifying.

hhqktif,qdetxc,"In my experience (so N equals one and all that) you can do quite a bit to influence how you're doing besides taking your meds and most importantly stopping smoking/vaping/freebasing/huffing solvents/etc\n\nOne obvious point is getting to a healthy weight, not only because carrying a lot of fat around is a strain to the system, but because overweight adds to the low grade inflammation which accompanies/causes COPD. In general you want to have as little inflammation as possible.\n\nEven though I wasn't even close to overweight, I've had a lot of success eating a ketogenic diet. BHB, one of the ketone bodies the liver produces when you severely restrict your carb intake, is a potent anti-inflammatory. Omega six fatty acids like linoleic acid are pro inflammatory, so you might want to cut those out too. Unfortunately they're in just about all processed foods with ingredients like soy bean/canola/sunflower/corn/etc oils. Most nuts are also rather high in n-6 FAs and because of what's in the feed, so is the fat of monogastric animals like chicken and pork.\n\nSo I stick to a diet with lots of fatty beef, lamb, low carb dairy, with leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables to taste (don't like veggies? Don't eat them). Add some eggs if you tolerate those (I don't). Fatty fish is great too. Maybe occasionally some dark chocolate or berries as a treat?\n\nThe common theme here is high fat, because you have to get fuel for your body. Protein isn't very well suited to be used as fuel, it's purpose is for maintenance, repairs and if at all possible to build more lean mass like bones, tendons, ligaments and muscles, but also for shiny hair, strong nails and plump skin (collagen is a type of protein). Low carb doesn't mean low calorie! I eat ~2750 kcal and I'm a 5'10"" 140 lbs mostly sedentary middle aged guy \n\nAs an added bonus, eating lots of red meat, preferably unprocessed, boosts your iron intake. For bonus iron points, cook with cast iron :-) Non-heme iron from veggies isn't nearly as bioavailable unfortunately\n\nThe second part of a healthy weight, or rather body composition, is increasing your lean mass. Unless you take shortcuts like steroids, a higher lean bodymass index is associated with lower all cause mortality across all ages, even more so for the chronically ill. Add some cardio and you're way ahead of the curve, COPD or no.\n\nCheck out r/bodyweightfitness, to get hecking fit and toned without having to pay for a gym membership. Or start with https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/routine if, like me, you have the physical fitness of a wet dishcloth :-)\nHybrid Calisthenics also has a YouTube channel if watching vids is more your thing. The guy is very easy on the eyes too. I'm not gay, but damn...\n\nA not unimportant aspect of doing (a variation of) the above is the sense of agency it provides. Working proactively to improve your health sure beats feeling like there's nothing you can do and that your life is basically over now you have an inevitably progressing chronic illness. Depression is really bad for your health, the mind-body dichotomy is a fallacy, there's only one you and if you're feeling like crap mentally that's going to affect you physically (and vice versa obv)\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdited to add that I just saw your post in the T2DM sub and if you decide to start a ketogenic diet, it's advisable to consult with your doctor as your Metformin dose will probably have to be lowered or discontinued altogether. At least get yourself a blood glucose meter, so you can keep track of blood sugar levels.
