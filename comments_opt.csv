i6nm5rr,uehrj8,I don't see any damage on the OCT to correlate with the VF.  I would've had you come back in 6 months to repeat the VF.  Visual field isn't always the most accurate.  Your nerves are a little larger than normal on the photos.  But the OCT shows no damage.  You still have an abundant nerve fiber layer (they grayish color around the nerve on the OCT).  And your IOP isn't high.  I would've kept you as a suspect.  Did she start you on drops?,1651233671,t3_uehrj8,/r/optometry/comments/uehrj8/hi_m27_my_mom_has_glaucoma_so_i_visited_an/i6nm5rr/

This led to me doing it for the last 11 years and my eyes weakened because of it I guess, especially with my phone usage. I realized that after scrolling facebook or tiktok for an hour or so with my phone close to my face is when my right eye would cross in, giving me double vision.

That alone explains monocular diplopia, but you modified the surface of your cornea with PRK. \n\nPRK affects the physical, optical shape of the cornea, and also changes the reflex loops that keep your tears flowing. That also happens with age, environment, and medications. .\n\nWhen your cornea is at its peak ""plumpness', the surface is smooth and polyopia is reduced.

In the modern world there is enough sources of vitamin A or beta carotene that we typically don't run into it, and those suffering from other disorders will show a large range of signs from that as well. It is however still a problem in underdeveloped and poverty-stricken regions since they do not have the luxury of food variety.\n\nVitamin A is important to vision because it is needed for the light sensing cells to make rhodopsin, the actual molecule that is triggered by light. People with a vitamin A deficit often will end up with night blindness because the low levels of working rhodopsin make the retina much less sensitive.  We can't see night blindness just by looking, but based on patent description and visual evaluation in low light conditions you can get a better idea if this is occurring. \n\nGenerally once the deficit is corrected (from diet,  supplementation, or treating why it isn't being absorbed/stored/transported) there is no permanent problem. The retinal cells go right back to making proper rhodopsin.

Every time it's just been my brain hasn't adapted yet, and I come off the other side seeing better with the new glasses than with the olds. Wider changes take way longer.\n\nCheck with the shop, check with the lab. But statistically, it's more likely that one week isn't enough for you. Also, don't cave in and use the old glasses.

Some patients have it and don't have any clue for years until they begin to notice more symptoms. I have caught many in my practice where all we see is an odd change in astigmatism correction. \n\nIrregular astigmatism can also occur after an eye infection and still not be KCN. I have had patients who have had a couple eye infections and or a particularly rough infection develop irregular astigmatism because of it. It's not the drops that cause it but people notice it after using the drops. The truth is it would be much worse had they not used the drops in the first place. \n\nKCN can begin really anytime. It isn't uncommon for patients to have it in their 40s. I see a lot of KC in my practice and refer patients for surgery for it quite often. \n\nYour original infection very well could be the main issue that caused all of this. That's the more likely scenario. Occam's razor says the most likely scenario is probably the correct answer. When you hear hoofbeats in the distance you don't immediately think of a zebra you think of horses. If you had one round of steroids and developed a long term reaction, it would be so rare that someone would write a paper on it.

i618qmx,ub0yad,"This is simply an educated guess so I‚Äôm curious what others would say. Alcohol can alter the amount of tension in muscles in the eyes (and the rest of the body for that matter). When you‚Äôre sober, your muscles are more tensed up which keeps your eyes from relaxing enough to adjust to your glasses when looking far away. I‚Äôm thinking the alcohol causes your muscles to relax enough to accept the rx at distance. A +3 is easier to get used to at near than it is for distance tasks, especially if it is your first pair of glasses. The fact that alcohol causes you to accept the rx at distance actually gives some hope that you‚Äôll eventually be able to adapt to them when sober as well.",1650826746,t3_ub0yad,/r/optometry/comments/ub0yad/recently_got_glasses_and_noticed_that_alcohol_has/i618qmx/

i60v8e7,uayl1s,"Hard to know what you are asking, but if I'm interpreting it correctly you are wondering why a lens (without intentionally added prism) inherently can introduce prism?\n\nOne way to think about it is the shape of a concave or convex lens. With a concave lens it is like two triangles on top of each other with their tips pointing at each other, and a convex lens is two triangles with their bases touching. Because of this the light is bent to bring the light into a converging or diverging shape, which is exactly why we use lenses.\n\nOf course this same effect will mean that the further off the central axis you go, there is a prism effect, moving up or down along the triangle shapes. You can't remove that without also removing what makes the lens work in the first place, so it cannot be eliminated. Luckily we try and get the optical center directly over the pupil, which means there is no induced prism when looking straight.\n\nWith freeform lenses you are not limited to shaping the lens along consistent spherical curves. Instead you're able to adjust the power as you move off the central axis, which can improve clarity when looking in that direction. This does mean that the induced prism power would be different too, but since the effectiveness of the lens to focus light requires that shape, it is still not eliminated.",1650821195,t3_uayl1s,/r/optometry/comments/uayl1s/why_is_there_prism_in_lenses/i60v8e7/

i5wvbs7,ua8wmp,"All right so this is what I‚Äôm seeing from the situation‚Ä¶ (FWIW I‚Äôm a student OD) \n\nYou need glasses for starters. I don‚Äôt know your age but as you said you‚Äôre a student so with an ADD I assume your eyes have been stressed while working on the computer a lot and they‚Äôre trying to help that.  However, your eyes are probably stressed because (I assume) you‚Äôre uncorrected, and if you get corrected (aka get glasses) you probably won‚Äôt need that ADD. (If you are younger than 35 years old or so then that applies, any older the add is purposeful) \n\nWhat the optician was trying to sell you is what we call ‚Äúsingle vision glasses‚Äù which would take care of the beginning part of your prescription (no ADD in it). The second pair I would see them trying to sell you would be near glasses which would include your add into your prescription. The third pair would be your sunglasses which using sunglasses is pretty important for your eye health but not absolutely necessary, you can always get a clip to put on your glasses, get transition lenses, or a pair of sunglasses that can fit over your glasses. \n\nIn my opinion, as someone who has to wear sunglasses for an eye problem and has progressives for actually correction, keeping up with two pairs is hell. Much less three pairs. Especially while in school. \n\nWhat I would recommend not doing three pairs. If you are getting glasses for the first time ever, do just the distance with no add prescription to start (so ‚Äúsingle vision distance glasses‚Äù), and see if that helps your eye strain. If you‚Äôve have a prescription before and the add is what‚Äôs new, then try progressives or bifocals. You don‚Äôt need two pairs. I promise. I lose mine all over and it‚Äôs a good 10 minute hunt every morning as to where I put them down. And like I said for the sunglasses there‚Äôs other options than getting ones with your prescription in it. And that‚Äôs purely if you want sunglasses. You can also get on your lenses a ‚Äútransition‚Äù lens that if you‚Äôre outside it‚Äôll turn into sunglasses, but be forewarned they don‚Äôt always work in cars because they work by UV and cars block UV light.\n\nEDIT: I know you said you have no symptoms of eye strain but blur is considered a type of strain.

i5uds4l,u9u94o,"Im just the moron doing quality control at the place that makes your glasses for your doctor.\n\nThis is exactly why it is important to get your glasses from an actual trained and qualified optician and not through an online web portal or some frame pusher at Walmart. An optician is trained to assess your wearing habits as well as your lifestyle in fitting your script to your frame in support of those functions. The more powerful your script, or astigmatism, the more induced prism and prism imbalance you can experience as a result from decentered viewing which in turn can cause compensation fatigue. Additionally in some materials like poly or high-index decentered viewing causes increased chromatic aberration. And to top it off; decentered viewing increases parallax or forshortening due to off-axis viewing which also affects the effective corrective power of the lenses.\n\nIn the example you provided that might be a decentration of ~8mm.\nLet's say you've got an RX that looks like this:   \nOD-6.00-2.00X030. OS -4.00-1.50X150  \nWith this script your right would have 6.0Œîdown while your left eye only has 4.1Œî resulting in a difference in prism, or imbalance of almost 2 diopters. In addition to the vertical imbalance you would also be inducing 0.69Œî & 0.52Œî base in respectively on both lenses resulting in a combined 1.21Œî horizontal imbalance. These numbers, and even the numbers for significantly weaker lenses, would be *wildly* outside of even the most lenient manufacturing tolerances.\n\nIf you habitually wear your frames in an atypical fashion that should be accounted for in the layout. You will find a significant increase in your satisfaction if you have your lenses remade to accommodate this fitting. \n\nYou could also look into so-called digital lenses. These lenses are ordered with no only your RX, but frame fitment data like how far away the lens is from your eye, the wrap angle, and the amount of pantoscopic tilt in the frame. The computer then spits out a custom prescription for those lenses in that frame that will provide your required correction as worn. \n\nI have a couple pairs of lenses I wear *very* atypically for some tasks, and I got talked into digital lenses for them by a coworker and they have seriously improved my satisfaction with them.",1650689859,t3_u9u94o,/r/optometry/comments/u9u94o/question_about_glasses_positioning_on_eye/i5uds4l/

i5stgd1,u9oljz,It sounds to me like this might be due to trouble with comfort of your new contact lens rather than your prescription. Being diagnosed with astigmatism is similar to being diagnosed with near or far sightedness and is certainly capable of changing throughout the years. It‚Äôs also possible that you may have had a small amount of astigmatism that did not warrant correcting with a toric (astigmatism) contact lens in the past. \nI would say to give your eyes some time to adjust with the new lenses.,1650662231,t3_u9oljz,/r/optometry/comments/u9oljz/misdiagnosed_astigmatism_for_20_years/i5stgd1/
i5stvly,u9oljz,"The new OD probably isn‚Äôt catching anything new. Most likely you responded in a way on the subjective refraction that led the doctor to believe your vision is better when astigmatism is corrected. I would venture a guess that the astigmatism correction in your toric lenses is mild, -0.75. I certainly have some patients with a low level of astigmatism who end up not liking toric correction in their contacts. Take some more time in your trial period to see if you adapt to the new lenses, if not go back to the optometrist for more troubleshooting.",1650662413,t3_u9oljz,/r/optometry/comments/u9oljz/misdiagnosed_astigmatism_for_20_years/i5stvly/
i5svcl7,u9oljz,"> Being diagnosed with astigmatism is similar to being diagnosed with near or far sightedness and is certainly capable of changing throughout the years.\n\nInteresting, see that is something I had been wondering about. Like maybe others hadn‚Äôt caught it before but now it has gotten worse. \n\nI‚Äôm gonna finish out the trial period and see if the discomfort gets better.

At the moment I‚Äôm leaning towards going back to my regular prescription but from what I‚Äôve read it kinda seems like it‚Äôs bad to not use toric lens when you have an astigmatism? \n\nWell either way, I‚Äôll be patient and see if I adjust.

i5u98lt,u9oljz,"Discomfort won't get better and you should consider comfort entirely separate from vision. A good lens should provide both, but comfort is more imporant IMO. Some torics aren't as comfortable as non-toric lenses even from the same company. Don't put up with discomfort.\n\nAstigmatism comes and goes and almost nobody has zero. It's possible if you test again they will measure less astigmatism.\n\nSo if you have minimal astigmatism, ask for a non-astigmatism (sphere) lens like the other eye. Fitting soft contacts, minor astigmatism gets approximated with satisfaction several times a day. \n\nBut all-day comfort is more important than perfect vision..",1650687074,t1_i5svcl7,/r/optometry/comments/u9oljz/misdiagnosed_astigmatism_for_20_years/i5u98lt/
i5svecc,u9oljz,It‚Äôs not bad for the eyes to use a toric lens if it‚Äôs not necessary. It would just make your vision less than ideal. Toric lenses can take a little time to adjust to. Good luck!,1650663076,t1_i5sv0u0,/r/optometry/comments/u9oljz/misdiagnosed_astigmatism_for_20_years/i5svecc/
